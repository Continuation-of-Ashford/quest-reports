The Jelly Mage

&nbsp;

We were tasked by Merrick to find out what has been killing new adventurers and put an end to it.

&nbsp;

Along our travels we encountered some strange magics in the forest which proved difficult to move through, we then met a beautiful lady who was looking for her sisters and she advised us on how to find and enter the witches hut.

&nbsp;

After locating and entering the hut, the party explored the various rooms and getting into some tough fights, finding the witches stash and taking some valuable items.

&nbsp;

Finding the secret entrance the party faced off against the 3 witches, which was the lady from the forest and her 2 sisters.

&nbsp;

They were a very deadly encounter almost killing members outright, but a well-placed fireball sent them to a swift end.
