The walk to the Nine Hells

We have been tasked with escorting Caliban from Port Red Key to the Portal to dis. After introductions at a tavern, he told us about the job. While he does not need protection whilst in dis, we are free to enter or stay by the portal, and those who don't wish to deal with devils should drop the mission. After some prep we set out.

&nbsp;

As we traveled, we came across a Deva statue. It seemed to be incredibly old and was quite decrepit. The entire head was missing and bits of it's wings and torso were missing. The civilization who built it was likely from the city of Anum, a wealthy place in Faerun resting just south of Baldur's Gate. Upon closer inspection, it seemed to be the work of the Harper's Guild. On a faded inscription had the name Arilyn Moonblade. With all this said, it seems incredibly out of place being NE of Port Red Key. Magical identification revealed it to be some sort of signal. We figured we needed some sort of code to get any further, though Skrom was able to figure out that we'd find out more when it was bathed in moonlight.

&nbsp;

Further along, we came across salt miners in the salt plains. we saw around 20-30 men toiling away at carving out large chunks of salt with beasts of burden and carriages ready to take it away. We leave them alone and continue.

&nbsp;

Continuing our journey, we came across some out-of-place lizardfolk carrying burlap sacks and were headding NE with blood driping from them. They were very well built and wore stronger armor than normal. One of ours were trying to figure out what they may have been hunting, but without getting closer it wasn't possible to tell.

&nbsp;

Some time later, we come across a man in a skull-like helmet carrying a coffin and dragging a greatsword. Once again we mind our business.

&nbsp;

As we get closer to the portal we spot a Succubus and a Hoplite. He seemed to be from Faros, the Spartan-State Archos. We stopped to speak to them and learned the warrior was on a task for his king. Apparently their queen has fallen ill and the warrior has been sent to find an item to cure her of her curse. He is currently on his way to speak to the friendly lich for information. After some idle conversation we bid them farewell.

&nbsp;

As we come to the Portal to dis, Caliban pays soul coins to gain entrance. We all decide to enter and head to the City of Dis. There are many planes walkers making deals here. We do draw some attention, though they are quick to get back to buisiness. We pass a massive statue of Dispater, the ruler of Dis, as we head twoards the iron fortress, the ruler's palace. An archfiend general comes down to speak to Caliban. He remarked about how Caliban is returning, and he has come to collect a favor from Dispater or Titivillus. 

&nbsp;

As we enter there are legions of devils. Dispater spoke to us when we entered, and asked us about our purpose  in the Nine Hells. Ultimately, Dispater and Caliban leave to have a private chat, leaving us to twiddle our thumbs whilst we wait. After Caliban received his dues, we went window shopping in the city of dis. We arrived at a Cambion's shop and she recognized Caliban and they exchanged pleasantries. We bought some trinkets and I exchanged gold of soul coins. With that we headed back to Port Red Key and completed the quest.
