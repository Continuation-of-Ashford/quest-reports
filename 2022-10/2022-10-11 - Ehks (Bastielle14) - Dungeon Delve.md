Dungeon Delve

&nbsp;

We'd been tasked with clearing out a dungeon that has wormed it's way into a now-dying druid grove. The quest-giver was upset that they sent "Newbies," nonetheless we've been told an awakend tree guards the entrance.

&nbsp;

When we arrived, there was an odd shimmering gateway at the entrance to the dungeon. As expected we were unable to enter. After backtracking a bit we arrived at a clearing with the aformentioned tree. It went down without any issues and we collected an odd wooden coin with the face of a bearded man on one side and a tree on the other. After defeating it we were able to enter the dungeon.

&nbsp;

We began exploring and eventually happened upon a spider den. We also took them out without much fanfare (though my familiar was eaten by a spider) and we collected 300 Silver coins, a spider eye, and another coin, once again with a bearded man and this time a spider on the other side. These were all within a chest that dropped from one of the giant spiders. We also found a well that goes very deep into what seems to be another level. We marked it down and kept exploring.

&nbsp;

We happened upon a room with a locked door and an odd circle on the floor. One of the lights were lit up. We didn't know what it did so we continued on.

&nbsp;

After ~half an hour of exploring, we came across some wooden creatures and a bear. After defeating them a chest dropped from the bear this time. Inside is 500 silver and another wooden coin. Once again the bearded face and a bear this time.

&nbsp;

We returned to the room with the glowing sigil and another one was lit. We figured we had to collect more coins. Setting off once more we came across a ritual room located in a temple of sorts. A boy layed on an alter and we discovered druids performing some sort of rite on him through incisions made on his body. We attacked, and throughout the battle they prioritized trying to finish the ritual. Their leader used some sort of ability to turn into a plant moster and gave us some trouble. Eventually we were able to overcome them and save the kid... well we thought we saved the kid, but then he stated "Thanks, but this isn't how it happened." And dissolved into the dungeon leaving behind yet another chest. Inside was a stick, a dagger, and another coin, this one bearing the bearded man and a child.

&nbsp;

Once we returned to the circle room, the door was opened and it led to stairs down into the dungeon.  We decided we were done for the day and returned to the town to discus. We spoke with the lady once more and she showed us that the coins have special effects when used.

&nbsp;

The Tree token replicates barkskin

The Spider token replicates spider climb

The Bear token replicates bear's endurance

The Child token replicates cat-nap, but is instant

&nbsp;

We decided to divide up the coins. They are one time use and if we use them, and we'd have to re-aquire the pieces.

&nbsp;

The dagger and Stick are both magical. The stick being a +1 druidic spell focus and the dagger being +1. We decided to sell the focus and then parted ways.
