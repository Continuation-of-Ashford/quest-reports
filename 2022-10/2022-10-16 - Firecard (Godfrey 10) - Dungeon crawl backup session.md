Dungeon crawl backup session

&nbsp;

We entered the dungeon fairly easily and had a small explore around to find a room where a ritual had taken place, after leaving the room we found a Giant Jade Spider, the party defeated it with overwhelming magic and moved on. 

&nbsp;

We found a magical metal statue but we closed the door and left it alone, no thank you!

&nbsp;

We then looted some boxes and the rest of the party triggered some oozes where Lu Xie died. We beat the oozes and Lu Xie came back to life, strange?

&nbsp;

We then got attacked by some crystal minotaurs which we defeated and decided that was enough crawling for one day
