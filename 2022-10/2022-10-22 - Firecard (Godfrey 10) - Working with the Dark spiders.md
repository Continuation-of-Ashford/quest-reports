Working with the Dark spiders

We have been given a task to take out the leader of a rival salt buisiness/gang called "The Hangman Group". The "Nooseman" is the nickname of the target and it's likely he won't go down without a fight. While Silan was apprehensive about killing, we were going to decide on the way there. We were to find him in the Port of Port Red Key alongside his men.

&nbsp;

After getting the mission details, we made our way to a bar on a seedy side of town and gathered information, luckily there were a few of them hanging out in the bar. We captured one and knocked out the others before whisking away the one we nabbed to be questioned. He told us where to find their hideout and after settling his fate we went on our way.

&nbsp;

Upon arrival at their hideout, we were unsuccessful in gaining entry diplomatically, however a horse and some rope got us entry. A large explosion went off at the entrance though no-one was harmed from it. We then entered the den and began combat, wading our way through their hideout. After killing some at the entrance, we had some....help from the masked man. The same one from the underdark and the last quest regarding the merchant. He deemed that our fate was moving too slow and...sped things along. Honestly I'm still reeling from it as a write this report. Regardless, we managed to complete the quest. I fear his power and have deemed in unessisary to remark exactly what he did, however I will offer a word of advice. Do not anger Richter.
