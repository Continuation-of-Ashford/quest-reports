Exploration of the Archipelago

A noble has contracted us to explore some islands west of the Greater Ashford mainland. We boarded the boat at Port Red Key and set out on our journey. During the travel over, we heard stories of a goddess of the sea rising paradise islands from the sea and the downtrodden rising up and coming together to protect the goddesses' gift, and other sea stories. After a few days of travel we spot land, however as we approach we realize that what we first though was an island that refused to get closer as we sailed towards it was instead a floating island. 

&nbsp;

The first island that seemed accessible we came across was devoid of the characteristic sandy beaches and peaceful palm trees and instead was an ashed filled wasteland with an active volcano. The next a dessert complete with sand dunes, cactus, and purple worms. On another it seemed like a normal island though possibly buildings from a former settlement on it. While they didn't seem sturdy and should have fallen long ago they still stand. The next held a Jungle that spread throughout the island containing dinosaurs. Continuing with the theme of each island being it's own biome, we found a swamp island, a temperate forest island, and a savannah.

&nbsp;

After some deliberation, we decided to land on the island with signs of life. As we rowed onto the island we came across what seemed to be a shipwreck and a castaway type island. Things that seem as though they should have washed away long ago remain almost stuck in time. After fighting the ghosts that we later learned to be guardians, a dragon came to us pissed that we slayed his minions. Unless we could offer compensation, we must slay the gigantic crabs on the island so they can be used as new guardians. At the mention that these islands were an unknown on the mainland the dragon became more curious than pissed. He informed us that we have found ourselves on the blessed isle and that he is the caretaker. He described it as a haven that all are welcome in, however those that come must maintain the natural bounds. The caretaker seems to dispose civilization, referencing the boat we came on.

&nbsp;

After our discussion, he perched himself on the building as the crabs made their way towards us. With a Wall of Fire, a Wall of Force, some tentacles, and a large snake we were able to subdue them without much issue. The dragon seemed displeased at something as we fought, though afterwards he commended us on our intelligence in taking down the crabs. He then created ethereal ghost crabs and we were allowed to keep the corpses and boasted about the bounties on the blessed isles. We brought them back to the boat, much to the celebration of the crew. 

&nbsp;

The chef on board created us some special crab cakes. They seemed to allow the user to gain a burst of energy from the crabby gooiness. After a jovial celebration we headed home with one of the islands mapped out.
