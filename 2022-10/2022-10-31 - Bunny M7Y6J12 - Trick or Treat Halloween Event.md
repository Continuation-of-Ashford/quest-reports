# Quest Report
`Author: Gentleman (Xia 10)`


There have been rumors of a merchant giving out magic items in Port Red Key. While the place has had some rumors regarding scams and shady dealings adventurers, including myself, have gathered to investigate and hopefully profit from it. Junior's guards informed him of the location of a suspicions carriage, and upon arriving we found the 'Duke' who was spreading the rumors, boasting about his reputation and self-nominated title. From his cart he pulled out multiple interesting items, A sword made from bone hailing from the east, A 2-sided pyramid with very sharp golden points, and a cane with a pointing finger at the top part. Each piece floated out of the cart as he set it infront of Junior. He decided to go with the Pyramid as the others disappeared. He continued to produce magical items from the cart, allowing us each to select one item from a unique set of three each time. Rasika, the newblood, took a crown looking item, Stig was given a rapier with a purple gem, and I recieved a canister with some odd, swirling thing inside. Upon further inspection, it seems to allow me to capture and consume souls in order to empower myself. All in all, a worthwhile endeavor. Be sure to visit him.
