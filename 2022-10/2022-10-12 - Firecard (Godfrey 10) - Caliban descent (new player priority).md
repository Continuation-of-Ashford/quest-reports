**Caliban's Descent**

&nbsp;

Our task was simple, accompany Caliban into the underdark for him to recover a Gem, we took the newer adventurers with us so it couldn't be too dangerous, right?

&nbsp;

We encounter a few strange hooded figures, one of which ignored us and the other seeked to ask personal questions, maybe this is common for the underdark?

&nbsp;

We had to traverse some dangerous pathways and sadly my horse broke the bridge, I was deeply sorry for that. I did not think.

&nbsp;

After crossing the Chasm we were ambushed by Gricks and we dispatched of them with relative ease, I took some of these to bring back to Momo, she did like collecting things.

&nbsp;

Lastly we found the Gem our benefactor desired, upon touching the Gem a Star Spawn Hulk Emerged, We attacked fast and true and it transformed into a filter of love.

&nbsp;

I apologise for those who can not speak Elvish, my written common is poor,
