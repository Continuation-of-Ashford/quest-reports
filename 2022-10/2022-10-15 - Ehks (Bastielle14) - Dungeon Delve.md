Dungeon Delve: Part 2

Xia returned to the currupted druid grove dungeon with her spider token. Her party was quite different than last and thusfar had only the spider token. time yet the mission seemed to be mostly the same, clear out as much as possible. Before setting out she bought a lot of rope and offloaded it onto her party in hopes of decending to the 2nd level.

&nbsp;

Unlike last time, the tree to enter was closer to the entrance. Once we defeated it, we were granted entry. The door was sealed shut, and the spider token's light was lit up. We decided to head for the well in order to try and skip the first floor. We lowered ourselves down into what seemed to be another floor. It may be like the room the well was originally in as it took a bit of searching to find the entrance. Nevertheless we could not find any way to continue, so we lowered ourselves to the next floor and took a long rest in a tiny hut. Within we found a chest with gold and a key which opened the lock door behind it. Though not before Lu Xie failed to pick it, and Chen failed to pick it, though their tools were wildly different. We formed up and began exploring, coming across snaking halways and eventually a door. Behind it was a room with two more doors, norht and south, and stairs to the west leading upwards. We infered that it likely led to the seccond floor and decided to continue exploring to the north.

&nbsp;

Eventually, we came across a door that led to a Stone and Fire elemental bear. We were cautious but managed to be victorious. When the chest dropped, within was A ring of fire resistance, 100 Gold, and A small gem that swirrled with brown and red. It turned out to be some kind of key. 

&nbsp;

Sadly, the next while was quite dull. We were all hunched over the map we were making as Skrom used the pole to tap around. We navigated a winding maze and came up with nothing for quite a while. After what seemed like ages, we came across a very ornate door with what seemed like slots for two crystals. Further adventuring had us stumble upon a Water and Air elemental bear. We once again began combat and were able to slay the two bears. Once again, they left behind a chest containing 100 gold, another crystal which swirled with crystal clear and turquise, and a ring of cold resistance.

&nbsp;

After sliding into a rope trick, we used the crystal to enter the final room and killed a Lightning elemental. We worked as a well oiled machine, taking it out after slowing it. It dropped a chest and within was a ring of lightning resistance, 500 gold, and a coin. On one side was a Bearded man and the other a caution for acid. With that, we decided to leave whilst we were ahead and take our spoils out of the dungeon.

&nbsp;

The token copies absorb elements, but only for acid.
