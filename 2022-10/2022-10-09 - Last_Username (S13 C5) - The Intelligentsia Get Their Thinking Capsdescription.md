Shroud has reason to believe that the ruins beneath Quethyr may hold a treasure trove of information about the ancient Durothil empire. Reaching this information may mean braving the fallout of a recently destroyed anti-magic field laying over the most advanced city seen this age.

**Going towards Quethyr**

&nbsp;

So I recently joined a guild, and together we decided to go towards Quethyr. 1 of our members seem to have checked it out recently, and now that the anti-magic field is gone it is a great place to look for knowledge about magic. 

So as knowledge seekers we decided to go for our journey. It was me, Glycon, Shroud, the one leading the way, Tabasnos, and Morbius. Luckily Shroud was able to quickly transport us there trough some mystical gates. 

&nbsp;

We actually didn't have much trouble entering at first. We looked around and shroud managed to guide us correctly to a room with beds. While Shroud watched over us the 3 of us entered the beds and our minds were transported towards a library. If my mind wasn't send elsewhere I would have totally checked that system out! Well while at the library, I witnessed some of the most amazing things. The books were all unreadable, not because it is the wrong language, but because all the words appeared blurred. 

Morbius Actually managed to activate something that gave us a puzzle. Use logic and intellect to solve it, and gain access to the books. 

With 3 of these tables in the room, I suggested we each take 1. 

Apperently that was the wrong idea and when I reached another one it exploded on me and the magic of it disappeared. So Me and Tabasnos joined Morbius to solve it. The first one was easy enough for me to figure out. After weighing our options it was clear what was true and what was not. This gave us access to some basic books These books actually became unblurred! But the knowledge seekers that we are, we now knew that going to the opposite table would give us a harder puzzle, but would also open up more advanced books for us. We got the question, and after thinking about it for a while, Morbius managed to gave the correct answer. While we looked around though we got attacked, a defence system that still thought we were intruders. 

While Morbius got hit hard, and tried to get his mind to leave, while Tabasnos succesfully managed to escape with his mind, I was protecting Morbius' side, making sure I could get his mind back up if it went down. 

Eventually Shroud and Tabasnos managed to pull Morbius out, and before I could properly attempt to leave myself, so did Morbius pull me out as a result. If not for this defensive system we might have actually gained a lot more knowledge.

&nbsp;

Luckily even an experience will grant you knowledge.

With regards, 

Glycon.
