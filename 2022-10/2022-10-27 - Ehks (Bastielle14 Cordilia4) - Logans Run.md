Dungeon Delve Part 3

We have once again headed to the dungeon. This time I had a token of Admittance (Usually we have to kill a Tree outside, this time we lucked out). After dispatching some surprise Wood Woads we quickly descended to the 3rd floor avoiding the spider nest and into the back room on the third floor we didn't explore last time. 

&nbsp;

As we passed the door beyond the lightning elemental's former haunt, we saw a  four young boys seemingly spring from the vined walls, running from older druids (also who sprung from the wall) who did eventually catch them. We heard from the end of the corridor where they ran from. We followed where they went into a sunny area devoid of the vines from the earlier parts of the dungeon. We became the peanut gallery as a conversation ensued about "James" and "Logan's" friends who were the other two boys running alongside them, the older druids framing the unnamed ones as failures. 

&nbsp;

The Leader of druids passed judgement on Logan and James as they seemed to have also wronged them, yet due to their 'value' they won't be put to death. They must instead carry out the two 'failures' punishments. Execution.  We attempted to reason with them, however they were distant and seemed as though they spoke to bystanders we couldn't see and not us, ignoring things that went against their apparent script. Unlike my first delve we decided to not intervene in the scene. They performed some sort of dark ritual and carved out the hearts of their former friends. At the conclusion of the ritual, the two punished became Wood Woads. After the scene James, the same boy from the first floor, told us through teary eyes that this was how it happened before fading away, leaving behind a Ring of truth telling and some gold. Beyond the corridor we found stairs leading to the fourth floor. 

&nbsp;

We left a door hub that all led to the same hallway. As we adventured we came across an incredibly well made room made of stone brick. Continuing along, we came across a bright and sunny area with pillars rising from the floor. We encountered air elemental bears as well as an air elemental myrmidon wearing full-plate and a flail. Throughout the fight in this space we survived multiple perilous falls (70 feet!) due to Silan's quick thinking with feather fall. Once we defeated them we found another chest, this one dropping a Lightning token. We doubled back on ourselves as further through the corridor was a 100-ft deep pool of water we didn't wish to traverse. 

&nbsp;

Through the other corridor in the well-made room was a room filled with lava falls and more elemental bears, along with another full-plate myrmidon. This one was of the fire variety and wielding a scimitar. I summoned a Vrok to assist, and while I couldn't hold control the entire time we were able to make quick work of them and send the Demon back to the abyss afterwards. Tapped out with a fire token in hand, we decided to leave the dungeon.
