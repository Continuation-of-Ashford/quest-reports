Counter Attack

&nbsp;

Roland and Shin started in a fight with some skeletons and a champion, things were looking bad until the party of Silan, Dagan and Nox showed up to assist.

&nbsp;

The champion pulled out a black orb but before he could use it they got hypnotic gazed by Silan and set up for a combo attack from the rest of the party which swiftly ended the fight.

&nbsp;

Silan picked up the orb and his hands started to turn black and so we thought of the best way to transport the orb, after a heated discussion between Dagan and  Nox the orb was wrapped in some cloth and put into Nox's backpack.

&nbsp;

After pressing on and being stopped by a lack river the party went the long way round and finally arrived in Nindamos and seen it was over-run by skeleton horde to which the party had to fight through to get to the source of the problems here.

&nbsp;

The team makes a break for the mausoleum and almost at the end Silan trips and falls over so Shin runs back and carries him almost the rest of the way, Roland heroically stands in front to take the brunt of the ranged attacks. Nox who transformed into a polar bear throws Shin and Silan into the mausoleum where they find another big group of skeletons.

&nbsp;

Once all the party is inside, we barricade the door to slow down the attackers from

the outside so we can deal with the enemies in front of us. After dealing with the enemies in the mausoleum the door starts breaking down so we press on barricading doors as we go along in hops of killing the necromancer and destroying his animated servants.

&nbsp;

Roland stands resolute and stands in the way of the skeletons allowing the rest of the party can make it into the next room so we can barricade it to attempt to slow the skeletons down some more.

&nbsp;

The party uses some stone coffins to block the door and make their way onto the Necromancer.

&nbsp;

Upon meeting the Necromancer she prepares to cast circle of death which Silan managed to counterspell with minimal effort. Nox teleported next to the Necromancer with their spirit guardians active.

&nbsp;

Nox got Power Word Stunned, but managed to shrug it off right away, allowing them to prevent something really bad that was about to happen. Just as Silan

managed to charm 2 undead champions and the Necromancer.

&nbsp;

Dagan Mind Slivers to kill the only undead champion not charmed then the party surrounds the sleeping Necromancer ready to all attack her at once while she's incapacitated.

&nbsp;

The Necromancer summons some undead thralls and attempts to finger of death Roland which Silan fails to counterspell and Roland takes a huge hit, but doesn't die.

&nbsp;

Silan, manages to hypnotise the Necromacer which allows the party to dispatch the extra skeletons that were summoned and allowed the party to rest a little bit to recover some abilities.

&nbsp;

Nox shaped into a Giant snake and restrained the Necromancer so the rest of the party can all hit really easily which eventually killed her, but then she dropped 

orbs which seemed to be something we should probably not be inside of. Which

was accurate as everything inside of the smoke imploded and disappeared.

&nbsp;

The mausoleum started crumbling and collapsing so we quickly escaped and made our way back home.
