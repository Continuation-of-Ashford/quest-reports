# Quest Report
`Author: Ignore Me J15|A11|T9|WD5`


Lord Goeffrey asked us to find some inventor named Daniels who can apparently create the super bomb he needs to kill the Mindflayers and destroy their base. All we knew about Daniels was that he had flying machines and lived in the salt plains next to moonrest, probably raiding the old automaton ruins of the elvish empire ruins.

We (Momo, Hiderion, Kadri and I, Tabasnos) sailed from Port Red Key to Moonrest. Then Hiderion used his Divination spell to get the location of Daniels base and after the cryptic answer from whatever god his asked his question to. So we went through the plains, searching for a good observation spot, and there, we spotted a relatively big flying ship with some smaller air transport doing small trips between the ground and mainship. We did manage to catch the attention of the automaton pilot of the smaller ship easily. 

We told him about the jobs and he(a seriously well made automaton) transported us to the main ship.

We met Daniels on board and he admitted being interested by the job offer. But he put one condition on his acceptance: that we took one with us of his souless automaton who gained self awareness recently but didnâ€™t gain a soul. So we asked him what could have caused such a transformation and he told us that the automaton was send to an exploration mission in Central Ashford, in a former Bahamut temple dating from before the destruction of the old elf empire. And he showed us what wonderful item the automaton brought back, alongside his new conscience state: a platinum dragon scale. Kadri used legend lore to learn more about the item and what he learned so impressed Daniels, he offered us each an improved ring of spell storage (up to six level of spells!). We took the automaton named Adam with us and Daniels told us he would work for Goeffrey. A quite easy mission with the most interesting reward, all in all.
