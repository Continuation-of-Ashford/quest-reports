# Quest Report
`Author: Gentleman (Xia 5)`


A Massive adventuring party gathered at MoonRest. The goal was simple, to escort Zhirra to a tree located at the northernmost point of Zen Coast and investigate a mysterious traveling merchant. Though instead of healing properties this tree is said to spring to life whenever creatures get too close. The Merchant herself dosen't appear to be native and arrived when the Silver Crescent guild released the news. Whether these are coorolated we do not know.

&nbsp;

After little fanfare, we all set out to the tree. Along the way we ran into a warforged. They had a dented head and stood quite motionless. The adventurer "Gweneth" approached and asked about it's injury. It than sprang to life and began playing music, stating she was now a contestant. He asked her a question that she failed to answer, before it fell over seemingly dead. Healing it was considered, but it was decided to loot it and move on instead.

&nbsp;

As we travel, we gaze about, I noticed something metalic glinting off of the light with smoke billowing from the point. After pointing it out, one of the party members flew off to scout it. It turned out to be a building built into the mountains with white smoke. Our charge seemed uninterested and expressed as much through broken common. Up until now she had only conversed through notecards. We ultimately decided to check it out though.

&nbsp;

As we approached, the building turned out to be more of a decrepid shack with white smoke pouring out of every opening. After inspection it didn't seem to be magical. Theoderik decided to take his chances and try the 'door' which fell off of it's hinges at the slightest touch. From within was a massive creature, as it stood the floorboards creeked and it hunched over so as to fit in the shack. Chen called out to "Hilda" in giant. Luckily for us, she seemed to just be "Taking a steam bath" and was not out to get us. After some conversation we learned that Hilda knew the "Moose" which was aparently also apart of the job, and agreed to help us find it. She gave us some sort of contraption that would lead us to the "Choose Moose"

&nbsp;

After clearing out the fog, it's a wonder how she ever fit in the thing. It was outfited with a sort of steamer basket and food...or the remains of what was likely food. Chen offered up Quill to take and attune to the small mechanical sphere, and when she grabbed the rather large device, it shrunk to acomodate her size. On the outside it looks like a silver pocketwatch and on the inside it had a compas without Cardinal Markings, yet it seemed to point to where we wanted to go.

&nbsp;

As we made camp and rested, a sort of odd midnight carraige came. From a trapdoor that sprang open, a short man with googly eyes and resembling some sort of beastman emerged from the steaming vehicle. Aparently this was in fact the Choose Moose Hilda spoke of. We were each told we get to choose three of three, and not to worry about him. He spoke in riddles but seemed to be harmless.  Many of the items turned out to be gags which seemed harmless at first but became harmless when he departed.  

&nbsp;

With that, Choose Moose departed in a flash. The effects that seemed harmful ended with his departure and this strange "Merchant" left us quite confused. After identifying the items, we found them to be a red chromatic rose, a ring of the ram, and a necklace of adaptation. The wand (Formerly staff) was not able to be identified, though it was certainly magical. We tested the wand, and it seemed to create a large pillar of incredibly hot fire errupted from it. Angora put it out then we followed the disintrested Zhirra's lead and went back to sleep.
