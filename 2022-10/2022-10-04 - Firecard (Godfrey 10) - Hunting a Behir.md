# Quest Report
`Author: aaazzzrrr (Calindal 13, T4, H5)`


Our journey began with an expedition into the southern peaks of the mountains, Thromduir's Shoulders, a place known to be the den of the behir we hunted. On our journey there, we met upon an entourage of black robed individuals under the nondescript employ of the drow's pit-fighting arenas. They brought along two trolls which they managed to capture and bind for these underground arena fights. Among them was a wizard, wisened in his craft and one which brought us a great deal of information about the mountains and the behir we hunted, as well as local ice druid covens that live in the mountains and hold loyalty to hags. He also agreed to exchange spells.

&nbsp;

Once we began our trek into the mountains, me and Tabasnos flying to adapt to the climb, we had our minds assailed by curious charms that brought our spells into nothing and made us fall freely. The spell was broken after a moment, as Cairnas held my form and Tabasnos was saved by Book likewise. I fear the ice druids control your mind in these ways, and I would not suggest any future climbers to ascend without protections against magic.

&nbsp;

After a while, we managed to find our way to the behir's den; an old and abandoned dwarven hold. As we explored it, we found the remnants of a construct that was powered by a core made from metal and fire, a magical pie, and several interesting items. At the time I was investigating the forge, and my allies the kitchen, the behir descended on us and brought Tabasnos low with a gout of lightning that sent him reeling on the floor in agony, and scorched Cairnas.

&nbsp;

With that, we began our combat. Tabasnos was brought up with a potion, Jo'Jo went ahead and cast magic to haste herself, Book sped up and tried to incapacitate it, and I fired bolts of fire from afar as I tried to run closer. Cairnas, however, did something incredible; within the blink of an eye, and a flash of power, he emerged into the size of a giant and hefted an enormous sword, booming with the sound of thunder, and cleaved into the neck of the beast with a critical blow. Tremors were felt at the force of the cut and I swear that most of us would be cleaved in twain if that were to come upon us. From then on, the behir merely rasped dying breaths and striked uselessly. Book landed the killing blow, breathing fire onto its bleeding head. The mission was successful, and all possible magical components were harvested successfully.
