Missing child

A Child has been reported missing by the  family. They live in a farming community near Dead Man's Post. Benjamin, the missing boy, is from the small family of five. As we arrived, we found Kevin and Lisa, Benjamin's siblings, milling about the farmstead. After bringing us to their parents, we were informed of his last whereabouts. Around a week ago he was out collecting firewood, along with some other children, however he never returned. The other kids returned home safe. The older kid watching over them reported that he disappeared after looking away for a moment. After getting their general appearance and where to find the kid who was watching over him, we went off to ask him some questions. 

&nbsp;

After arriving at the older kid's house, we found Renold outside chopping wood. After inquiring about the situation, he offered to take us to the site of the disappearance and remarked that he noticed large spider webs around the place despite them not being native to the area.

&nbsp;

Upon arriving to the location, we discovered that something with teleportation powers took the kid. After a divination we discovered that something called the "Dark One" took the kid. Some detect magic later we followed the trail and stumbled upon someone calling himself the dark wanderer. He insisted that he did not take the kid, but saw who did, presumably the dark one. He theorized that a priest of Bhaal was involved and pointed us in a direction. After Glycon gave him mushrooms he departed.

&nbsp;

We made our way to the location of the "undead aberration" and found the boy who appeared on an altar within an odd building. Upon closer inspection by the paladin, we discovered that something demonic was lurking inside the boy. Upon putting a holy amulet on the boy a demon, presumably the 'Dark one' appeared. They remarked that the priest of Bhaal should have dealt with us and summoned three demons to assist him: A Vrock, a Shoosuva, and a Herou. After defeating the Dark One we revived the boy who had been caught in the crossfire and returned him home.
