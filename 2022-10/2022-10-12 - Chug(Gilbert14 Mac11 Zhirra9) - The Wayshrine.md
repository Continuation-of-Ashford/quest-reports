Our first crusade began on the dawn of an autumnal day, preparing ourselves for a journey that would last three days and nights. Strapping all of my equipment, along with a tent and bedroll, my companions also prepared their weapons, for conflict was to be the omen. 

&nbsp;

On our first day, we encountered a farmer and his family bringing a tithe in the form of his meagre harvest to Moonrest, to pay homage to the temple. Where I saw clear and faithful practice, Gwynneth was wiser and knew that the farmer was in need and was suffering, and so gave him back his harvest. Speaking with him, she learned that a noonwraith, the accursed spirit, is haunting his farm. My brothers in arms have an errant quest to fulfill, then. We shall seek the noonwraith another time. 

&nbsp;

On the edges of the great mesas, we settled for a few moments of respite in a Kwoni trade camp where we conversed with locals and sat by a fire. The desert could be quite cold in the night. Cairnas himself found intricate stones that one merchant sold, most of them emanating clear magic, and others mere aquamarines. These stones proved to be valuable and were a fair investment of gold.

&nbsp;

The next step of our journey was to pass a great river, one that fed all of the tribes and gave life to the desert, flood plains rolling in sight. Cairnas used his magical apparatus and summoned a spell that allowed us to cross over the water.

&nbsp;

Then, we arrived within sight of the wayshrine that we have been tasked to purify by the very god Analor. The land was blighted in its viscinity, and where once lived no folk, there we found a son that lived in a windmill, a daughter that became an acolyte, and a mother that taught them all she knew. All three tended to the shrine. But upon further inspection and peaceful discussion, we gradually found out that they gave praise to a foul goddess of pain that abhorred the sanctity of death; Loviatar. They were followers from another ancient order of monks, that were taught to cause pain in battle; the Disciples of the White Rod. Conflict was sure to follow.

&nbsp;

We were brought to the shrine graciously by the son and daughter. There we saw the utter desecration that occured in the shrine, and a caretaker covered in hideous scars, tribute to her foul goddess. Where once stood a shrine to the Seldarine, a pillar for the elves, there was a shrine to all they stood against. Gwyneth talked with the caretaker of the shrine for a long time, hoping to find a solution without bloodshed. We interjected between the arguments, yet our hope for a peaceful resolution was soon fading in realization that we were in total opposition. I stepped forward and gave an ultimatum; flee, or be destroyed. The priestess murmured, doubtless to her goddess. Then, the priestess of Loviatar raised her hand, and with a ruby that was the most pristine I've ever seen and a few words and motions, sealed us inside a forcecage and walked out. I called to my steed to stop her from leaving, but she uttered a powerful word of death and my steed was destroyed on the spot. She left with her two children, and gave us the omen that 

&nbsp;

After a few moments, forces of darkness converged on our shrine, fiendish creatures: a chain devil, an erinyes, and a yagnoloth. We began a decisive melee with them and brought blow after mighty blow upon both fiends, seeking to tear them asunder and smite them away from the material. Cairnas swung his sword, Gwyneth supported us from the rear and rained down holy radiance, and Zhirra fought hard against the titans. Our battle was a decisive victory.

&nbsp;

Then came the task of purifying the shrine. I tried to cleanse it with my touch. It didn't work. Then my three companions tried striking the shrine piecemeal with Gwyneth's holy mace. Nothing. Then, I came to wield that mace, and smote the shrine with all of the radiance I could summon at that moment. Light erupted in droves. The shrine was cleansed. We returned home triumphant, but our crusade is not yet over.
