The Lady in Blue

Lord Bartlesby has called upon us once again. Last time we gave him info on a lady in blue and we have once again been tasked with going to deal with her in moonrest. 

&nbsp;

After some discussion amongst ourselves, our employer called us in and informed us that they had new intelligence based on the lead we gave them. Essentially, somewhere in Moonrest another lab has been setup, however they haven't hit the distribution phase yet. They have the location of a potential safehouse and want us to conduct a raid on it so as to stop it at the root. Once again he wants this done quietly...as in no survivors. He marked the supposed location on the map, though other than it's presumed location they have no other details. Details on who is behind this, their goals, and how they create the potions is also something he wants us to retrieve. If we can ensure that word doesn't get out, a bonus is in order.

&nbsp;

With questions answered, we departed. On our journey we happened upon a lone cupcake. As we passed by, Glycon fell into a trap beside the cupcake onto some crude spikes. A crazed man leapt out of nearby bushes, exclaiming that we ruined his trap to trap the "Mc-Guffin." After listening to his ravings for perhaps a little to long, we decided to head on our way.

&nbsp;

Further along our travels we passed by an old, rugged stone, seemingly a shrine. After closer inspection Chen discovered it was a shrine to Torm. Chen decided to leave an offering, but I refused Torm's blessing.

&nbsp;

Upon reaching Moonrest, Hiderion utilized Divination in order to pinpoint the location of the hideout. As the omen presented itself, we followed it to where it led us and happened upon an abandoned house. As we entered we discovered that what we first thought was dust was actually blasting powder. We were all able to quickly escape the house as we were being beset upon by bandits. The wizard with them made it a tough fight, however we were able to take them out and question one of them.

&nbsp;

After speaking with them, he told us he was hired by the Lady in Blue to trap and kill us, using this fake place as a cover. The wizard with them was to facilitate the explosion. He says that the Lady in Blue is in Moonrest, and if we did want to try to her, we should be cautious as they are quite powerful. After thinking hard, he said to go to Moonrest, track down the product, and trace it back to them, similar to last time. Hiderion enquired as to how they hid from the guard, and he said that they use a combination of illusion magic and hidden locations.

&nbsp;

On the body of the wizard, we found a picture of his child who was kidnapped with odd writing stating if he didn't kill us he'd never see her again. Once we finished up at the house we headed back to Port Red Key to report our success.
