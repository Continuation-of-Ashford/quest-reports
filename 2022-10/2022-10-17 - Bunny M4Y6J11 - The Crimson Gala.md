# Quest Report
`Author: Gentleman (Xia 6)`


The Crimson Gala

We started by seeing the flier which asked for adventurers. The "Beautiful Woman" who put in the request met us in a tavern where the others who took the job gathered. There was a new face, a Feral Tiefling who went by Ken'si (You could never guess his vocation). Once the monk introduced himself we waited for the job to start. The bar itself was quite high-class and lavish. Even the bartender was dressed in a Tuxedo. After conversing with the employee we learned that the quest-giver was shut in her room but would likely come down to have a drink soon.

&nbsp;

After knocking on seemingly every door, we found the correct room and decided to wait until nightfall for her to come down so that we could talk about the mission. After ~2 hours she emerged and we began discussions.

&nbsp;

The benifactor was a vampire who had created a demi-plane where they did not have to worry about "food." Where we come in is that one of her nobles, Solomon, has been getting restles, spouting Vampire Supremacy over mortals. She wishes to not have her kingdom divided and due to us being unknowns we can act as her helpers. She plans to host her Crimson Gala, a meeting between "mortals" and vampires. She wishes to keep war, both internal and external, away and due to this it is to be handled delicately. Removing him is not an option, as such she must maneuver carefully.

&nbsp;

Currently, Solomon has taken it upon himself to kidnap a handful of nobles and stash them in his dungeon, one the Benifactor knows us. She will create a portal for us to go in, kill what's inside, and take the nobles out. The catch? Once we get inside, we have 5 minutes to get in and get out. Anyone we encounter that isn't the nobles must die, as dead men tell no tales. 

&nbsp;

Once preparations were finished, she opened the portal and we began the mission. The "dungeon" was deficiently a noble's underground prison. As we went in we, for some reason, split up. Although it was harrowing, we were able to take out the vampire spawn and save the various nobles. Chen insisted they grab wine from a storage cellar we found but only one complied. We killed everything inside and left no witnesses, completing the mission.
