**Solving another problem of Godfrey**

&nbsp;

It has been a while since I have written a report, but I am travelling with some others and in a bit of a rush so unfortunately I don't have a lot of time to write much. Luckily not much happened that I feel are worthy of further investigation since we didn't encounter any cool magical effects.

I got together with some familiar faces, besides myself we had Hiderion and Morbius. I also got to meet Yoho who seems to have been here for a while now. And 2 new faces have yet again appeared around Kasr, William and Xia.

&nbsp;

Anyway, we didn't get to speak with Godfrey, but after talking with some people who work for him we set off towards the underdark. Godfrey had some trouble with Kuo-toa, who seem to be following an evil priest. So we either talk the priest away or a battle will break out. I think we can all guess who has won the battle.

While we travelled to the underdark where they were we found some of Godfrey's troops that had killed ogres. Later we found a tree with healing tree blood. Lets hope we can find it again in the future.

&nbsp;

Anyway, lets ignore the rest of travel. Once we entered we managed to get to speak to the priest. After our only undercommon speaker wasn't convincing enough they just attacked us.

Long story short, the Kuo-toa are leaderless now.

&nbsp;

Only future problem we need to keep in mind is a man who seems to gain strength when creatures around him die. He escaped before we managed to restrain him, and seeing how strong some of his items were he is someone to watch out for. Man would I love to investigate that item further, the magical spells that it might possess.
