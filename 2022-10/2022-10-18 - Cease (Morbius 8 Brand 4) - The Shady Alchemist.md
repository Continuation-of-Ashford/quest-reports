The Shady Alchemist

We have been tasked to meet at the town hall, and do so discretely. As we arrived, he quickly inquired as to if we were the adventurers and then ushered us into the back behind a thick door. The room itself was a small office space, yet it had no windows and was lit by a single torch. 

&nbsp;

Once we were inside this dreary room, Lord Bartolsby told us that there was an issue in Port Red Key. He lamented that healing potions were being smuggled in and sold unregulated. Usually they are able to stem the flow, however whoever is selling these are skilled at what they do, and have yet to be caught. They are severely undercutting all the prices on the continent. The potions themselves seem legitimate, yet those who imbibe them quickly become addicted to it. Those who go without suffer withdrawal so bad that they die, and there have been three confirmed deaths thus far. We're to deal with them at our discretion, and with discreteness. 

&nbsp;

The symptoms include mental and physical deterioration, as well as grey skin. Those who continually drank it disappeared after a week. Noone of them have been tracked down. The only lead we have is to look about the poor district. Hiderion used divination magic and there was an omen. After turning the corner, we found a gangly teen scurrying away with a suspisious sachel. We caught up to and questioned him, and he confessed that these were the potions in question. He said he got it from an underground place and they let him sell it. He sells it and is able to keep some of the profit. He gave us a scrap of paper with a well-drawn charcoal map on it with directions on where to go. His name was Jim-Bob. With that we let him go and headed to the location.

&nbsp;

Upon arriving, we came to the hallway with a cellar hatch leading underground. Once down there we got to the door, the dwarf mentioned that Jim-Bob sent him in order to become muscle for the gang. This allowed us to gain entry into their lair in order to talk. Their...interesting looking leader told us that they were looking to expand and that they needed guards. We lied when we gave our name save for Glycon. She called herself the lady in red and beckoned us to follow her. 

&nbsp;

We got into her office and she offered us 25 gold a week to work for her. For adventurers, a horrible offer. Skrom pushed for more information and the Lady told us that the next location was being setup in moonrest. We are to ask around in the lower districts for the lady in blue. From there one in the know will guide us to who we seek. Once we got the info, we dealt with them and searched the hideout. The guards came and hassled us, but ultimately Lord Bartolsby helped us out. We got paid and left.
