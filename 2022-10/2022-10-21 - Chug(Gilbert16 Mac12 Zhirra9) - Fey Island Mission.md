**The fey island mission **:

&nbsp;

Last time we went to that particular Island it was with Blorg and we wisely decided not to explore. Why? Because we made a previous visit there, a force teleportation to the palace of a winter fey called Doren, with stupidly powerful reality altering power. And I didn’t regret not risking my life just running around her place again.

&nbsp;

So today mission was a job for Shea. The Dragon hired us to guard Doren from another insanely powerful fey called Cuen. Here what happened:

&nbsp;

Calindal, Poppy, Godfrey, Jojo, Felix, Cairnas and me, myself, I, Theodorus Gibbeousmoon the third met Shea at her Rest. Turns out Doren expects to crush Cuen easily “any time” but he sometimes uses “voices” he stole from people he killed as “foot soldiers” and she didn’t want to be swarmed. You know before she crushes him, any time now. So she asked Shea to bring people, because her barriers are weakening (but Doren can beat Cuen anytime!!!). So Doren, who is apparently born from the imagination of some sick sick kid, welcomed us, more politely than last time, which should be indicative of how much she needed us, despite her repeated claims that Cuen was going to lose.

&nbsp;

She still forced us to entertain her, so I did some acrobatics like last time and Felix played music and the rest did some move.

&nbsp;

Then Cuen showed up: he was a tall big muscular man,a rare form for a fey creature and obviously half-elf and formerly mortal according to Doren. Cuen was immediately interested by Jojo, a fact that Jojo warned us would happen. It’s probably linked to that devil thing that was possessing kids, she made some deal according to the reports. But I am not in a position allowing me to judge. You gonna do what you gonna do. 

&nbsp;

And we did exactly that and what we needed to do was killing. Cuen resisted Doren’s maze spell (or at least a more powerful variation) and her feeblemind spell. Oh and he resisted my magical crossbow and other people magical attack like it was easy. Only a few things managed to hurt him “normally”, Felix’s psychic attack, Calindal’s divine smites and funnily enough Godfrey’s cursed blade. Cairnas later fireballed him, killing my owl before I could check if it was also reacting to thunder damage and I was forced to continue firing my target from far away without my owl providing help.

&nbsp;

As Cuhen decided to stop attacking Jojo and concentrated on damaging the people actually hurting him badly, Poppy decided to use toy soldier of all thing. She was apparently planning to use as a construct in the fight. The unexpected result was that just seeing it made Doren panic and she just disappeared, leaving us without our main support. Cuhen started doing terrible damage to Calindal killing him. He stole “his voice” and a copy of Calindal appeared to fight on his side. Shea decided to teleport us out of the fight and we all (well not all) managed to get out of the house, ending up outside, in that damn winter land forest. Shea revivified Calindal and teleported us to her village.

Shea did fall into a short comatose state shortly after teleporting us but she woke up quickly enough. Calindal hasn’t be able to talk since his “voice” was stolen by Culen. Shea also fixed part of the curse on Goedfrey sword so it no longer damage him when he uses it but is still cursed enough to do damage to Cuhen in the future. We got some “decent” reward and a few good magic items and got told that Doren will be back and Cuhen will still be there. I hate fey but there is money to be made. I guess.
