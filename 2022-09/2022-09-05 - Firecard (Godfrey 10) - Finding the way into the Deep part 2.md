**More mind flayer magic**

&nbsp;

So this is the second report of Glycon Cyfrin since he has arrived into the formerly unknown region of Ashford. 

We have had a follow up on the previous mission that I was on. We were on the look for finding in way to deal with the lake. Now that we were safe from the mind control, we needed to find ways to get around in the lake.

&nbsp;

After weighing a few options we decided to visit a (good looking) witch. 

On our way there we found someone rambling about devils, but we will look into that problem at a later date. Only so many mysteries you can deal with on a day.

&nbsp;

The witch was quite nice, and gave us a few much needed spell scrolls for free (like water breathing). However what she wanted in return for the rest we could not deliver.

Which was good news for me (besides the fact that I learned I might have competition for her heart) because that meant we now went to meet 1 of my favourite people that I have met on this island, the lord of Nindamos.

&nbsp;

He was yet again very helpful and without much trouble he handed us what we needed, along with a device that he requested we would use to capture the brain of the elder of the mind flayers. That seems like a very reasonable request since we will attempt to get rid of them in the future anyway! Plus it gives me the time to check out the device more.

&nbsp;

When we made our way over to the lake we swam around for a long time looking for caves. The caves were needed as a possible spot to hide a teleportation stone.

The fact that we had to swim around did unfortunately mean that I could not use my new flying capabilities to its fullest extend. But I know there will be other moments for that!

&nbsp;

It took us a long time but we finally found a cave that we could use. Well, besides the fact that a dragon lives there that is under the control of the mind flayers. You know, small issues with the plan.

&nbsp;

So after we rested on land the next morning we set out to find a different cave, and eventually we had success. We even made a friend along the way who was hiding in the cave we entered after escaping the grasp of mind flayers (and apparently also escaping from some murder hobo with a bow that kills people for sport). 

&nbsp;

The cave can now be used as our teleportation location. 

We took the elf with us back to Dead man's post.

Still waiting till I actually meet a mind flayer. Seems like the magic they posses is amazing!
