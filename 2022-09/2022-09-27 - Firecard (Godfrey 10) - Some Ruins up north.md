Hiderion's Journal: Hunting Artifacts

&nbsp;

Our task began with meeting an archeologist named Daniel that wanted to build a museum in Dead Man's Post, dedicated to the memory of the elves, my people. The task began fairly simply, with us having been given a location and instructions as to what waa valuable to the archeologist. So we set forth on an adventure to explore the Elven castle, left barren for a millenia.

&nbsp;

On the way, we met a monster hunter called Liam, riding a horse that had difficulty carrying the head of a manticore Liam supposedly slew. We offered our aid to the horse, to give him Bull's Strength, and for that Liam gave us an Elven amulet that no doubt had value to the museum.

&nbsp;

When we entered the castle, we immediately noticed an arrow trap, and I feared the presence of undead guardians, though that fear was unfounded. We found an alternate path. In the castle, we had a few quick encounters with mimics, animated armor and magical statues that gave us, and especially me, pause, and then we met animated spears, weapons that we had to dispel and rid of magic but we still found them useful since they were pristine. Note to self and future readers: sir Tabasnos is inept at strategy, and reacts brazenly whenever a threat arises. Unreliable in warfare.

 

We scavenged what we could from the ruins on the surface, then went to explore the basement.

&nbsp;

Inside the basement we found a stone golem, guarding the entrance to a tomb filled with eldritch abominations, ancient liches, vampiric elves that betrayed their people, and all manner of horrors that none of us wished to explore. So we simply stayed away and went back with what we found. For future parties, please know; whatever you intend to do in this tomb, bring hefty protection and divine magic.

&nbsp;

On the way back, we met a man by the name of Mister Finster, a self-proclaimed "jack of all trades" that wore a jester's mask, a leather duster, and several closed pouches of unidentified material. Alleged that he was hired to be many things in his career, in many settlements. He asked us about the things we carry and found no interest in them. Our short discussion revealed nothing of his intentions, and I doubt he is trustworthy. Keep a man wearing a jester mask heavily scrutinized if ever you meet such a man, if the creature is a man at all.

&nbsp;

Our mission was continued and accomplished from this point on without any difficulty.
