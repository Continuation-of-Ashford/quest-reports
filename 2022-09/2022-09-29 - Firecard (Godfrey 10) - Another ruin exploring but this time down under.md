I write this on the way to Moon Rest. Daniel, had another job for us. This time to look for statues in the Underdark Fairly straightforward.. and then subterranean. I do not much like that place. Exploding mushrooms, poisonus mushrooms... Giant spider men.. Man-spiders? I do not know.. Driders, they called them

&nbsp;

We found a book, near the corpse of one (we made the corpse) and it told of dark rituals and such that had been enacted to empower this drider. So, I reckoned we should drag the book to Moonrest, see if the godheads there could make heads or tails of this ritual. Perhaps counteract it somehow should we find more of these in the field.

&nbsp;

In any case, we also found some statues. And they where broke when we found them, but we did a bit of fixing-up and then got them dragged to the surface. Got our paychecks and went our separate ways.
