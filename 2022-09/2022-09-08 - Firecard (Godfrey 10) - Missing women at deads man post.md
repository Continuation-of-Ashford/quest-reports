# Quest Report
`Author: Last_Username (S13, H5)`


*A piece of paper that seems to have been torn out of a journal is recovered in the adventurers' guild.*

Found first thinking creatures since crash.  Their communication is primitive.  Could only speak to one.  Safety in numbers, so stuck with him.  

Sent to track down other missing fleshy two-leggers in town full of them.  Went to building full of them with more of their disgusting fleshy bodies uncovered - a revolting experience.  One with least clothing told us missing people were in sewers, so we went.

We found the missing women.  Escorted them to the surface.  Deeper sewers had demons and  witch with several enthralled guards. The witch knocked me out with an icy blast- when I came to, the guards were arguing with us over their dead comrades.  

Scent overwhelming me.  Left sewers. Hope to find shelter in forest near town.  Hope to find rest of clutch here.  Must be here.
