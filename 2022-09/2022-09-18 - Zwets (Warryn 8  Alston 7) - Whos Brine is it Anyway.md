# Who's Brine is it Anyway
It has been several months since the Mindflayers kidnapped most the Sahuagin. A certain Dwarf from Thromdur's Keep believes this has left certain temples of great historical value unprotected.  Rangrim Ironmace is looking to pay a group of adventurers a modest sum to protect him while he documents what the Sahuagin have left behind. He also claims there might be additional rewards in the form of gold and gemstones that the Sahuagin offered to their shark gods, should the trip go swimmingly.
