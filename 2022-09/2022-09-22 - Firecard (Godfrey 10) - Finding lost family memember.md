# Quest Report
`Author: Ignore Me J14|A11|T7`


This report is written by Tabasnos Whitmore, wizard of the Intelligentsia of Port Red Key. 

Were part of this adventures: Hiderion, a bladesinger(?); Book, a monk; Chik-Tha a Thri-kreen fighter; Brimstone, who is, I guess, someone; Glycon, another member of the Intelligentsia: a wizard with psionic abilities and experience as an artificer; and of course myself, Tabasnos Whitmore, wizard and author of this brief note.

The adventurer guild needed us to help them repay the debt it contracted with the “friendly” “lich” wizard of the “city” of Mindamos. They needed us to find his “descendant” a high elf woman named Dawnstar, who was living in the north part of the continent of Quethyr, “probably” in the area on the coast east of Menthyr. We needed to make sure she was wearing a pendant given to us by the “lich”. I was told that the pendant wasn’t dangerous but wasn’t able to fully discern its full nature, due to my lack of access to appropriate Lore and Legend divination spells.

We went from Kasr to Port Red Key and asked the local sailors if they had any information on the suspected area of our target, but the proximity of the nearby Pirates Island makes it a no sail zone. Any attempt to get more information from local adventurers (namely the slightly renowned Blorg) about any local settlements in that area proved fruitless (captain Blorg is apparently at sea, searching for a place to build a pirate cove that isn’t already a pirate cove), so we took a boat to Moonrest and asked the local clerics to contact their gods to get more information. The woman we were searching was indeed living on the coastal area east of the mountains next to Menthyr.

We went on a road trip, mostly because of the pirate presence at sea, and we ended up fighting a really confusing creature apparently named a Jabberwock. It spent its time making the most confusing and insane noises, which helped its two companions, both wyverns, in their attempt to kill and eat us. We managed to kill them all after a violent fight but failed to extract the really weird eyes from the Jabberwock head. I think they would have made a fine enchantment product, had Book succeeded. While we were taking a short rest in a Tiny Hut after the fight, a young blue dragon came down from the sky to prey on the Jabberwock’s corpse and took it away, probably back to its hoard as some free road-kill diner. You have been warned.

We did continue on our trip and finally met a bard woman named Paris travelling on the back of a stone giantess. After some arduous talks(which Brimstone nearly derailed with his unique Goedfrey-level charm) she admitted knowing the lady Dawnstar, and agreed to give her the pendant but added that she couldn’t guarantee that the woman would agree to wear it. Fine enough, I personally found her extremely honest in her claims and her prices. She sold us many magic item at a decent price and of really good quality.

She also gave us the location of many places on her side of the continent, amongst them, I think you all will find them interresting:

_ *New Waterdeep (original name, do not copy!)*: a merchant city on the tip of the east coast, founded by the people of Waterdeep summoned in the area (like in Kasr? By another titan? Or the same titan, just in another place?)

_ * a drown city * : with an entrance hidden between Quethyr and Ooethyr, in the plain, east of the mountains. Another deep purple style entrance, but hiding like some kind of white snake, I guess.

_ *a gate to the hellish city of Dis*: situated north of the bay north of Shea’s Rest. Devils trade in soul coins there.

She also warned us about several creatures in the area:

_ a Death Knight, living in his fortress, up the mountains pass towad Menthyr 

_Several gems dragon a young one and a older one who is obsessed by war.

_ There are Yetis in the path on the mountains road between Quethyr and Ooethyr
