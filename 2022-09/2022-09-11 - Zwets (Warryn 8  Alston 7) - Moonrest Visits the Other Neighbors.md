# Moonrest Visits the Other Neighbors
On behalf of Moonrest Calindal spoke with both groups of nomads that travel the great Mesa. Managing to make a good impression.  There was however a potential problem... People had been spotted in 2 places at once, which led to the conclusion that these impersonators may commit crimes against Moonrest disguised as a nomad, or vice versa.  Asking the Kwoni shamans about these imposters led to a group of rogue shamans, at least 1 of which was in self imposed exile due to an unstable mental condition. Guided by the spirits the party found a hollow rock. Doesn't seem like there's a doorbell either.  Just how crazy and paranoid was this lady that she couldn't live with her tribe anymore? "Kindly tell her to stop impersonating people and it'll be fine" kind of crazy? Or "sets booby traps and has monsters in her own home" kind of a crazy?  Time for some adventurers to find that out...
