# Wrath of Titans
The Fire Giants have not looked kindly at the rapid expansion of Port Red Key. The tension has seemed to have reached a breaking point; the city suddenly finds itself besieged as flaming boulders are launched from on high. Armies have begun pouring down the mountain to lay siege to the city. Adventurers are being called to help break the siege before all is lost.
