# Wrath of Titans
The Fire Giants have not looked kindly at the rapid expansion of Port Red Key. The tension has seemed to have reached a breaking point; the city suddenly finds itself besieged as flaming boulders are launched from on high. Armies have begun pouring down the mountain to lay siege to the city. Adventurers are being called to help break the siege before all is lost.

"I knew it was only a matter of time before, yet another, threat came for Port Red Key. I do not claim myself to be a champion of the down trodden or protector of the people...in fact as far from that as I can get- but I always try to do the best I can by any person that needs help...or I call friend. But after today, I am having trouble seeing the good in anything outside of the settlements and people of Greater Ashford. 

&nbsp;

Today fire giants from the mountain came down to kill and murder. We managed to fight them back, and capture one of them- who told us 'We intend to vassalize you and reclaim the resources that are rightfully ours'. I do not know how killing helps any of this- helpless city dwellers and the likes......I wanted to kill this giant, and the rest of them- teach those that would threaten my home a lesson. But Gwyn and Calindal talked me out of it- encouraged further discussions between the giants in order to focus the true remaining threat- the Kython. We let the giant go- and will have talks with their chief....Theo- please meet me in the Intellegensia study when you see this"
