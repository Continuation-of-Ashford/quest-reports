# Quest Report
`Author: zarz (Cairnas 11|Nox 5|Glycon 5)`


**Religious shrines** 

&nbsp;

So, not sure if this is much of a quest report, but it might still be handy to let everyone know what we are working on. 

Because me, Gwyneth, Calindal and Wally had a bit of a strange experience. We recently started up a guild together, and before we could really get started we all had a mind voice telling us to get together in the main moonrest temple. There we all heard the voice again, apperently from Naralis, giving us the task to cleanse the shrines of the land we are on. Problem is that Naralis didn't give us directions to where they all are. Moonrest has one, and Gwyneth knows the location of another, but that still leaves a few. 

&nbsp;

So we decided to go down to the shrine in moonrest, to hopefully get some more clues. On our way there we met Jo Jo again, and Zhirra. Lets just gloss over what happened there except that Zhirra seems to have joined our group, before running away again. 

Either way, With Jo Jo here we decided to go down together with 5. It was my first time entering that cave but I know it won't be my last. Beautiful. There is an amazing metal statue, with metalwork I have not seen before. And 2 obelisks that makes me scratch my head. These are unlike anything ever seen before, it really left me speechless for a moment. There is a magical glow coming from these obelisks, and they are made from igneous rocks. But how they crafted these I can not say, or whom crafted them. The edges alone are special. 

Either way, we didn't get much information from there, besides the fact that the igneous rocks might mean we need to head to a vulcano. We will check it out, as well as the location Gwyneth knows, and if we don't get more clues there I get the chance to inspect the obelisks even further. Now it is just waiting for the right moment to set off on our journey.

Still not sure how to end these reports...
