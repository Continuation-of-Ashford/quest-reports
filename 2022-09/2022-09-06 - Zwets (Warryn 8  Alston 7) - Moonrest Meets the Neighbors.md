# Moonrest Meets the Neighbors
It is that time of year that the nomads living in the Mesas pass through the wooded area near Moonrest.  Three strange machines, that look somewhat like sailing ships but walking on legs, have arrived ahead of anyone else. The people on those machines seemed surprised to find a settlement, that wasn't here when they passed through the previous year.  The nomads have asked to have a friendly chat with their new neighbors. To try and make a good first impression and all that.

# Quest Report
`Author: aaazzzrrr (Calindal 12, T4)`


It was a bright and auspicious occasion when first we met with the nomads of the great barren mesas and the sands outside the walls of Moonrest. Tribes of people, ingenious and hardy, sent word to us when our people first met, and I led the delegation with a few comrades and a mercenary, as well as my brothers in arms; all to represent Moonrest infront of new and ancient neighbors.

&nbsp;

We came upon their sandcrawler that was camped not too far from the temple, a day's travel at most. We met upon their host; a mixture of goliaths, ogres, and humans, all working together in unison aboard a massive ship that sails the sands. Representing them was Ubg, self-proclaimed 'firat ogre-neer,' and his was the Bossa tribe. A tribe that values community above all and holds different views to faith than I have known so far. A tribe of inventors and hard workers, braving the dangers of the great mesa to mine stone that dispels magic and fuels wonders. Our conversation was very cordial, and we have developed a kinship between us and cemented a road to cooperation. The next step was to talk with the other tribe, the Kwoni, for which Ubg gave us a token to present his favor to them. The journey to their camp took a fair bit longer.

&nbsp;

The Kwoni, in contrast to the Bossa, were religious folk that worshipped the spirits of animals and ancestors, led by a council of elders that held the knowledge of generations upon generations of the wisest of their tribe, going back more than a thousand years. They told us their history, their slavedom to the Durothil elves, and what they knew of the old faith of those same people. The schism, the birth of dark elves, the corruption of Araushnee, all of it led to the sundering of the faith among the Durothil elves, and their ways were lost to darkness. I told them such; Moonrest will never allow such darkness to befall the elves again, never again such cruelties be inflicted upon other innocents. I showed them the truth of my faith, and they saw fit to accept Moonrest. We shall meet together in a few moon cycles in the city.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, this story is not without its complications. In the Bossa tribe, when Ubg agreed to our friendship, he admitted to a growing fear among the tribe; people were being impersonated under suspicious times, with all too convincing magic. The Kwoni elders told us the same, for they were the first to notice through their connection with the spirit realm and all the animals. They suspected the perpetrator to be one of their own, an elder that retired because her body and mind were failing. Apparently, she made a pact with an angry spirit and tried to hold on to her position fervently, losing memory of the fact that she relinquished it in the first place.

&nbsp;

So we set forth to either heal her mind or put her to peace, and as I write this letter from the perches of a tall hill that was found to be her home, I prepare for a harrowing. May the Lunar Lady bless me with her grace, for I carry her mantle to the ends of the earth.
