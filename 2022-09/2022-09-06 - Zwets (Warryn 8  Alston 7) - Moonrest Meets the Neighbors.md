# Moonrest Meets the Neighbors
It is that time of year that the nomads living in the Mesas pass through the wooded area near Moonrest.  Three strange machines, that look somewhat like sailing ships but walking on legs, have arrived ahead of anyone else. The people on those machines seemed surprised to find a settlement, that wasn't here when they passed through the previous year.  The nomads have asked to have a friendly chat with their new neighbors. To try and make a good first impression and all that.
