# Quest Report
`Author: Ignore Me J14|A11|T8`


A group of drows from the underdark, all Eilistraee followers, wants to move to the surface to escape the persecutions they are the target of by the Lolth followers. They reached dead men post and their leader Neer, needed our help to convince Godfrey that they weren't going to ruin his place. Neer is a former folllower of Lolth and has been the target of her former clergy member since her conversion to Eilistraee, the godess of dance, beauty and song. Poppy managed to convince him and the drows are starting a village north of Dead Man Post, in the place formally occupied by the orcs.
