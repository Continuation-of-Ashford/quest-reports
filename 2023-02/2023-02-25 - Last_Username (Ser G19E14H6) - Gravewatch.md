# Gravewatch
A series of murders has cropped up in Dead Man's Post recently. So far, the guards are stumped at who is committing them or why they are occurring. The victims are mostly unrelated, the bodies show no sign of injury, and the number of dead are far greater than what one person could do alone, yet no manifesto has been found. They have reached out to adventurers to investigate and resolve the cause of these deaths.
