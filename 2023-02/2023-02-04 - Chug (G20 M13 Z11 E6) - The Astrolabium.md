**I still hate Trasinger(Trasinger adventure part 3 or 4(or 5?) depending on how you count)**

 

It’s still a bullshit island but after our little adventure with Count TORTURETHEKIDFORMEPLEASE, we reached Abigeal’s place. Abigeal is an “auto-gnome” a warforged like creature of intellect and science. 

After a brief recap of all was publicly know about “the blight”, we shared Calindal’s discovery on how to cure the “Blight” and it aligned with her “the bligh is extraplanar creature” theories. With Dispel Evil and Good being the only thing working and Calindal’s Divine sense not detecting undead, fiend or celestial we managed to determine that the type of extra-planar involved was either Fey, Elemental or maybe some rarer kind of celestial(according to Abigeal’s theory)? But Abigeal needed to see the girl we healed sooner and sent with her brother back to the port to embark to Port Red Key, you know before she took a boat and left this cursed island behind. She said she would know the type of extra planar creature with just some minor tests and would be able to create a cure to the “Blight”.

&nbsp;

At this point the Inquisitors showed up at Abigeal’s place, accusing Godfrey of all the troubles the rest of the team caused during Count IAMAMONSTER thing and ordered him to follow him to met THE EMININCE in person. Felix decided to follow him. But yeah, we had to split the party.

&nbsp;

So after Calindal and Poppy brought some material from Abigeal (a soul coin procured from some local Tiefling named Meridith for Calindal and a Ring of Red Fury for Poppy) and we all flew east, trying to catch up with the kids before they could reach the town.

&nbsp;

We found the kids surrounded by more Inquisitors. The inquisitors were actually helpful to the kids, offering them a way to the town hospital. Calindal managed to convince everyone involved to go to Abigeal’s place to experiment. Abigeal managed to do so and found the type of extra-planar creature involved: some kind of rare emotion type celestial called the Asfaraba. She also managed to create a wand able to cure the blighted people.

&nbsp;

Apparently stuff did happen between Godfrey, Felix and the EMINENCE and his Vice Roy. According to Godfrey, the Eminence is a useless creep, an extra planar and the exact type of celestial who are causing the Blight and the Vice Roy is just an opportunistic asshole. Felix may have more to say about it.

&nbsp;

The thing is when we all did regroup together at Abigeal’s place, Calindal felt the need to use his new blight cure wand for the first time. I hope nothing bad happens.
