# Climbing the Infernal Spire
Massive infernal chains summoned by Vhaerun's faithful have pushed their way through the earth into the very heavens above Moonrest. From them, demonic servants of the evil god threaten the realm of Sehanine Moonbow herself. She has called for aid from the most powerful adventurers to destroy these chains before a disaster can occur.
