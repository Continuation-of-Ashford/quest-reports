# The scavenger hunt begins
Gilbert, seeking a measure over the flow of time, wants to assemble the Orrery of The Wanderer. To do so, he will have to find its constituent parts flung all over the multiverse. So far, the only lead he has is a captain who once pursued a similar goal who might be stranded at the edge of the crystal sphere. You will have to travel there and possibly do some favors for them.
