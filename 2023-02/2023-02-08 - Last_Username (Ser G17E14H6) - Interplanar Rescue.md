# Interplanar Rescue
Cairnas recently fell into a portal that leads to the Astral Sea. While I'm sure he's enjoying the vacation, he has responsibilities back at the guild that need seeing to. Go out with enough creatures full of blood and a friend to reopen the portal, drag him back home, then close it again.
