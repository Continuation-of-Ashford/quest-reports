In my warroom, news came to me of conflict arising in the vicinity of Emith Hilith once more. Wings unfurled. Either drakes, or dragons.

&nbsp;

Summoning my trusted friends and allies in Moonrest and additional volunteers, we set forth, traversing the wind in the form of vapor, soaring to the wayshrine. There, we found out that three of the five wardens stationed in that wayshrine were missing. I took to the skies to peer around the valley. Near the tower of day, something new was constructed, perhaps of our make. Perhaps not. Beyond the foothills, a giant travelling north. The pass was blocked by wind and ice. And to the north, smoke. The fog of war. We set forth north, for time was of the essence.

&nbsp;

Marching through the night, trekking mountainous paths, we met upon a pool of nereids whom spoke druidic. They granted us their waters to drink from, and we were revitalized. We kept on our journey, spirits high.

&nbsp;

When we arrived, we saw a shrine, a draconic shrine to an unknown sun dragon deity. We dispelled blue fire that rained down on the shrine, of psionic make. A troubling realization, considering the destruction Cuen and the north islands have shown. Once that happened, I opened my senses, and a foul smell caught my nose. The stench of undeath. A moment later, a moonstone dragon descended onto the treeline, having fell from a great height, filled with wounds yet still living. Three massive shards, the likes of which we've seen in the north, were embedded in its abdomen. A horde of undead, covered in those same crystals, came charging at the dragon. We rushed to its aid.

&nbsp;

Fending off the horde, the shimmering shields of those undead, born of their crystals, were slowly being eroded by our might. They were too feeble to stand against us. And then, when we felt we made progress and landed a decisive blow, a massive explosion, enough to kill a mammoth, rocked our bodies with the power of undeath. We could not win this fight.

&nbsp;

Instead, we attempted to resuscitate the dragon by pulling out the crystals embedded into it, and keep it living long enough to recall safely to Moonrest. When the dragon came to after Gwyneth's powerful, careful attention, it teleported us to Shea's Wake.

&nbsp;

Our mission was a strange sort of victory, received to us by accident. We saved Shea's draconic sister. A mighty ally, and a wise sage, one who could tell us much of the Fallout of Cuen. But that shall be seen to when Rak Tulkesh is destroyed.

&nbsp;

May the Lunar Lady guide my hand,

Calindal of Moonrest
