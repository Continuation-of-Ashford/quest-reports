# Quest Report
`Author: Ignore Me (J8 A6)`


**Rescuing a *lost* Dwarf **

*I was told to* warn *you that a dog dies during this report so… ** __you are now warned__**. * 

So Geoffrey called for adventurers to free a dwarf named Gardan(????), who was then *assumed* to be a prisoner of the *drows*. Because Geoffrey needs him to start a dwarf prostitute franchise or *whatever* because his current money plan owning a village in the middle of nowhere (but far way from bugs I bet). I don’t know honestly. I do not care either. The problem is that he lost his precious precious little dwarf and he needs it back. *Dudes, where is his dwarf???*.

So we have a group: Gilbert, Poppy, her sister Bastielle, Felix(and his cat), Nashera, Varesh, Urisk. And of course me, myself, I, Theoderik Gibbeousmoon II, Baron-mayor of the freehold and insect-invasion-corridor of Port Red Key. We all met at Kasr and quickly move to the Deep Purple underdark entrance, go east when we reach the underground lava trail and reach the Drow city. Someone should put a few tolls along that way.

We then learn from the sun-deprived locals that the only dwarf they had fitting our profile search was a clan Krakenhammer leader *who they executed a month back*. So I go the local club for gentilhommes and deadly ladies and who do I found? Knights of the Cross-Trade who are already selling stones under their long dresses in my little fishing village! They want to see me. I am a super star. Their pretty woman leader wants me to sign a dumb piece of paper. I happily oblige. It protects them from my town-guards, but it doesn’t protect them from anything else. Like sure. Also little known fact, killing drug dealers in my city is not a crime if the drug dealer isn’t a citizen of my city and if you have the proper papers proving you are working for an allied settlement (alliances’ signatures pending), so murderhobo away! And selling drugs in Port Red Key still is a crime. I literally don’t care what you carry through town as long as it not slaves (, *cough* Geoffrey *cough*), so they can always enjoy doing that. 

They are so happy with the paper I signed, they tell us the true: Gardan was not captured by the *drows* but by the *duergars*. What a difference! Oh and we need to move East, to a smaller cave-town, to meet a barkeep, tell him “Vanessa sent us” and get the exact location for the soon to be dead pale dwarves. So we go there, find the town market and end up spending a stupid amount of time and money buying over price magic weapons, armors and shield, hiring booksellers and acquiring soon to be dead pets (well, I would stay away from Gilly’s new cat if I were you, far more scarier than Bastielle’s now *dead* dog.  || You were warned.||). Also Geoffrey bought/freed a slave named Beatrice that now *works* for him. Because  you know sex-work is work. Also I own him a debt. 

We go to the bar and we get the location. Then on the way to the Duegar base, I feel the need to enter an abandoned base. I stealth through it with Felix behind me and in the calmer part, the cat and the dog make enough noise to trigger a Grick attack. Which trigger a Hook horrors’ drive by. Lot of the underdark’s unique fauna dies. We find some gold and a big diamond in the ruins. We lost time, we gonna miss the boat! We run. We reach the Duergars. They want to burn the dwarf to some unknown chthonic god and/or titan. We rush them, we kill them. It’s an extremely nice performance from everyone but, if you ask me, Nashena was the most impressive, only getting hit once while blocking at least 4 duegars for a whole minute. The dog dies here in this fight. || You were warned.||

We rush out of the underdark. 

**Also if you are able to cast regeneration, I will pay you 1000 gold to regrow my soon to be missing left arm. This has nothing to do with the report but it’s a nice place to advertise. **
