3 Firstflow, Year 1574- Notes from Cosmos

&nbsp;

"Today has been.....thought-provoking. I was finishing a contract for illegible in the lower district of Baldur's Gate when I suddenly was pulled from my environment to.....wherever this is. I found myself awaken on a cold obsidian surface in a strange land. I only have my traveling supplies on my person, so from the start I have been at a disadvantage.....the ex-wife of my employer was my last mark, and lucky for me I still had pieces of her personal effects on my person, so I improvised and utilized her likeness before exploring my surroundings....Self Note: Vane Underhill was the name used. 

&nbsp;

After exploring this village of backwater cultists, I happen upon....well what they referred to as an Adventurer's Guildhall. I would not consider this hall a whore house on a rainy night, let alone a Guildhall, but I played along."

&nbsp;

Contract to kill undead in a high elven city by the name of Lindon accepted- Notes to follow on adventurers:

&nbsp;

Gwynn: Accent is clearly of the Golden Kingdom. A chaotic land that many legendary adventurers grace. Self Note: Her relentless pursuit of justice and connections may be viable for future. Find information on familial ties.

Kadri: His accent is to ubiquitous to pin-point, but is most certainly from the Sword Coast. Self Note: Investigate further- something about him reminds me of the mission in Barovia. Self Note: Disregard for others when his life is threaten is apparent- could be viable leverage. 

Vasreth: Accent undiscernible.....yet the few glimpses I caught from his hooded face...definitely Shadow Elf. Self Note: Viable accomplice for Drow Operations.

Vullwin Krisvyre: An eccentric sort- I did not recognize his accent nor his homeland he mentioned. Self Note: Utilization of cane is for combat purposes- he is not disabled....but his left eye seems damaged....possible weakness if needed.

Asterios: Minotaur. Very strong build, utilizes runic techniques- expert in close quarter combat. Self Note: Low intelligence and greed may be a viable leverage if needed.

&nbsp;

Mission Report: Traveled with party north to a Goblin Camp- managed to extort a pouch of residuum. Traveled farther North to Lindon- battle with undead ensued- countless numbers. Overall victorious. Self Note: Be wary of Vasreth's mental connections/Be wary of Kadri witnessing use of Fey Power.

&nbsp;

Follow on mission: successfully infiltrated the goblin camp- will collect items of monetary value to start building personal assets- more to follow.
