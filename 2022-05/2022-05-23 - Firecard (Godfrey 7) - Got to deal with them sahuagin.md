Got to deal with them sahuagin

Went to Sahaugin cave

Saw mind flayer sushi bar

Killed a mind flayer and its sahuagin thralls

One mind flayer got away

Went down one floor, saw two regular mind flayers and one big armored one doing some big ritual

Ran away immediately

It is important that everyone panics immediately.
