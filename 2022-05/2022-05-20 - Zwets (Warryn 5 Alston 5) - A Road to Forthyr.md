# A Road to Forthyr
Alston is always looking for ways to improve the world around him and he believes that allowing easier access to and from the teleporter in Forthyr will be just what the village of Kasr needs.  He's produced tools and wagons as well as hired a couple villagers, but is now looking for adventurers to help him path-find and secure a route. The guild has agreed a reward will be offered to adventurers that help out the effort.
