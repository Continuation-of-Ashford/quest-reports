# This Mine of Mine
Headed into the mines
### Description
Because I was fooled, tricked and bamboozled by Sesh bot into thinking there was a session this evening during Yurp time, but there wasn't. So here is a short notice one.

A completely trustworthy dwarf, "definitely not kobolds in a trench coat and a fake beard". Has arrived in Kasr.

They are asking if the people here perhaps have had a violent disagreement with a certain blue dragon recently. In a "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" kind of way, they are hoping for some free help reclaiming their goldmine that has been taken over by kobolds worshiping the big blue dragon.
