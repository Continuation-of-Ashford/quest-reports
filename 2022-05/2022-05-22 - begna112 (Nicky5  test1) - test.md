To Lady Tarraâ€™az, Dura, Depths-side, City of Sharn

(The following text is encoded with a cypher, but a simple Comprehend Languages easily fixes that)



-This is Warryn Nibler reluctantly writing you.-

-Compelled to supply you information.-

-Currently located on Toril. The Farashad Islands. Port Red Key.-



-I have begun requiting guards for the local garrison.-

-Find attached the notes on their background and families, should you later need to manipulate them.-



-Engaged in an expedition to the home of Shea Evergaol, a silver dragon.-

-A transported individual known as Blorg funded the expedition.-

-Other transported individuals, Theoderik Gibbousmoon II, Poppy Lowe-Tine, Bastielle Dr'asroth Lowe-Tine, Urisk and Thorfinn, aided the expedition.-



-Area east of Port Red Key is infested with giantkin, some smaller raiders, to multiple titan sized ones.-

-Supposedly a Geriviar from Ebberon has been transported to this island, though I was not able to verify its presence myself.-



-Expedition also found a construct of high elven make. Sharpie nr. 3-

-The construct revealed it was created by Fendith Qeullana and its last master called Paperios had been deceased for over a 1000 years.-

-It also named 11 high elven teleportation installations.-

-Forthyr (located), Fenthyr (located), Rapthyr, Volthyr, Balthyr, Oolthyr, Menthyr, Renthyr, Quethyr, Xelthyr and Nepthyr.-

-The construct was able to point to these on a map.-

-Though the associated constellations for each might be more helpful to use their teleport functionality.-



-Hope this missive never finds you-
