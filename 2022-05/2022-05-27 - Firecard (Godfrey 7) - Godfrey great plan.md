3 Firstflow, Year 1574- Notes from Cosmos

&nbsp;

"Need to sharpen my skills more yet- today I was forced to show face with a party I signed on with. But I was purposefully abrasive as to dissuade the others from wanting to ask to many questions......I need to think harder on how to approach these adventures as opposed to my previous work, perhaps the time I have spent at court has dulled my senses.....unsure. Furthermore, there are far to many 'do gooders' here, the things they spew from their moths and morality is sickening...but I can not let my own morality get in the way of business......more to follow...."

&nbsp;

After signing on to assist a descendants of Richard- legendary of adventurer of the Golden Kingdom- I travelled further inland for the second time. This time to directly West instead- contract to secure source of building material accepted- notes to follow:

&nbsp;

Gwyn: For one with such a strong sense of Morality, her willingness to assist one with such disregard for the same is perplexing- further observation required.

Vullwin: Self Note- may pose threat in the future, strong sense and insight has was main cause for seeing through my disguise. Ensure preparations are in place to force cooperation or disposal if necessary.

Logan: Obvious Druid- has based himself out of forest to the Northwest of Kasr. Primal abilities give him flexibility in combat- along with control of nature allows for viability out. Self Note: Forest seems precious enough for possible leverage- burn if necessary to force cooperation in future. Find possible relations for additional.

Felix......and his cat Roscoe: After seeing his combat skills for second time today- in close combat at that- it is clear- He is a Blade....I wonder why he is not more open about this...Self Note: Low Intelligence proved my Mind Flayer today- exploit this.

Torquato: Quite Harengon- gods I hate Haregons- extremely skilled with a bow. Self Note: quite nature made it near impossible to read- stake out required- follow after next mission.

&nbsp;

Contact with dwarves successful after encounter with Eye Drake and Mind Flayer - this land is strange to have such creatures freely roaming the wilds. Assisted Godfrey in getting a discount on stone material- but when Logan asked for assistance, he refused to pay and attempted to skim additional supply from Godfrey- I notified the Dwarves of this and secured an additional 500GP in resources for future operations. Self Note: Apply these tactics of entrapment in the future to Godfrey- low intelligence should make quite viable and lucrative. 

&nbsp;

Follow on mission: Infiltrate Logan's Run- then Move to Port Red Key for follow on information gathering. More to follow.
