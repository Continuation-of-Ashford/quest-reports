The Rescue

Merrik has tasked us with finding the reconnaissance party that went missing looking for other missing groups. Apparently she herself went scouting with some others and were injured. They discovered that there were mummies along with some other creature there though their reports weren't affirmative. After conjuring mounts, we set out immediately. Along the way, we came across a large, green breathing mound. After closer inspection, we found it to be an Adult Green Dragon which was very close to the Kasr area.  It claimed to be looking for it's sister before flying off. Apparently the sister in question is already dead as confirmed by Kadri. 

&nbsp;

Eventually we made it to the temple where we encountered dead mummies and an Oni. We were later able to piece together that the mummies we saw out-front were the bodies of the first two adventuring parties. After slaying the Oni, we came across a journal on it's body, and a portal that led to a tomb. The journal detailed how the Oni was tasked with acquiring more minions which led it to the tomb. A short scuffle with mummies later and using tongues to have a brief conversation with Tak'Ma'Gra, the mummy lord of the tomb, we found the bodies of adventurers including a recently-dead dwarf and we made our exit with the bodies. Through the conversation we found out that the Oni had invaded their tomb in order to get the servants his master demanded. While this angered the mummy lord, he did not take it out on us and allowed us to search for the bodies and go. While the Thri-keen and Drow were mutilated and beyond saving, the dwarf was revived once we were out of the dungeon. Unfortunately we weren't able to loot the tomb as we would have met heavy resistance and the others were not keen on it. Once we left he seemed to seal the entrance behind us. I doubt we'll be able to enter there again.
