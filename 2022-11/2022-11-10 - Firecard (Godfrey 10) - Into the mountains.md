# Quest Report
`Author: aaazzzrrr (Calindal 14, H9)`


We began our mission together at the tavern, converged all at once in the same agreed place and time. Our task was to find the tomb of a long-dead high elven wizard of the old Durothil empire named Izual, and obtain his arcane grimoire. A man by the name of Douglas contracted us for this purpose, seeking the book as an artifact for a museum of the same empire.

&nbsp;

On our journey there, we had to go through mountains and rivers, frozen peaks and tundra. On the way, we met Victor the mage, and we exchanged words that I don't wish to discuss here. There onwards, we met a friendly and intelligent yeti that let us spend time in his cave. We exchanged stories and curiosities and ate from the meat of an auroch as we did. Siraha was his name, and he was raised by a taciturn ranger. He leads a lonely life, but a life nonetheless.

&nbsp;

We then met upon the frozen corpse of a paladin of Bane with a black blade lodged inside him. We took it out as a magical artifact for use later.

&nbsp;

Once we came to the doors of the tomb, it was clear that it was guarded by wards. Tabasnos dispelled them posthaste, and inside we walked in the dark and damp tomb until we met upon an undead knight which bid us to go immediately. We refused. Combat ensued, the undead residents of the tomb rising up against us. Through walls of fire, stone, and force, we wizards foolishly entrapped ourselves in a zone of death we lacked control of, and our wayward fighters were left to sulk. A regrettable outcome. Through the smoke and gas, our employer nearly dying, we banished the knight into a pocket dimension and quickly attempted to find the grimoire. When we came to the main hall, the wizard awoke. We discussed the fate of the world and with a silver tongue, Quill granted us a diplomatic solution and the wizard Izual gave a copy of his tome to us. Our task was complete. Silan quickly searched through the tome for more knowledge as we stood in awe of what just happened. Let it be known, for the future generations... the High Elven Empire fell in no small part due to the blood moon, like the Spellplague.
