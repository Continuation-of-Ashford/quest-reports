Into the City of Dis

Caliban has offered to take us to the city of dis. In exchange for some money (which after some haggling the price was reduced) he would lead us to Dis. After paying the toll we set out. During our journey we came across many interesting scenes and a bit of trouble including a Roc we managed to scare away, A village sacked by the Follower's of Bane, a Headless Horsemen named Jerald Light-Fingers who was cursed by a witch and thanked us for lifting it, a member of the Red wizards of fey in his mushroom tower who was not keen on visitors, some powerful undead we managed to wipe out, Avitus the leader of the Follower's of Bane on Greater Ashford, and Zen the man looking to slay a dragon. After dealing with each one as they came we finally made our way into the Iron city. 

&nbsp;

Once we were within we bartered with Devils for magical scrolls and items (Hiderion got scammed by the scroll merchant though), and ran into an old Acquaintance in the priest of Bhaal before waiting in line at the door of the Iron Keep to meet with Dispater. After a few hours of demonic nuts and wine, we made it to the front of the line and were able to speak with him. Once in his audience I requested to be allowed to setup a settlement on the other side of the portal. After settling on some favorable terms, we completed the deal and took our leave.
