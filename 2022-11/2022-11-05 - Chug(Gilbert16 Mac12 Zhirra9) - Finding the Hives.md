`Author: Ignore Me J15|A11|T9|WD6`


The group was Calindal, Jo’jo, Book, Shroud, Gilbert and me, myself, I, Junior.

We started an exploration group to go find that desert tribe of nomads near Moonrest (the “Bossa” tribe, I believe or maybe it is the “Kwoni” tribe; I never really care about large group of people until they start causing troubles in my town, it is a free world, and those tribes are 100% moonrest’s problems) **in order to get the location of some Kython hives**. After many fruitless discussions in Moonrest on the ideal strategy to find the nomads and the usefulness of a mute paladin, we decided to go explore at the most common locations in the desert, *hoping* to find *some* traces of the tribesmen. 

We did succeed. In finding *traces*. No, no corpses… because the Kythons dragged them away. But many remains of a fight were found near a river’s bed. I even found the full Kython hive nearby. *Joy*. We did our best not to trigger a repeat of our first encounter with the Kython and Shroud managed to find the central zone of that nest with around 40 full size kythons spotted by his psionic eye. We also found some weird corpses, more of those terrible small kythons eggs and Book increased his collection of curios by one skeleton with weird hands. We managed to exit that place without triggering a fight and decided to continue searching for the tribe.

After some effort we found a temporary trade post and learned that the tribesmen believed they had killed the only know nest in the area recently. We told them how wrong they were and they promised to help us when the hour of killing all the Kython will come. They also told us ACID works really well against the younglings. Good to know.
