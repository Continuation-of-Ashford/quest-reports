# Quest Report
`Author: Ignore Me J16|A11|T10|WD6`


We went to explore the source of the undead and after a small trip we started exploring a tower.  We found some magic stone linked to the Dead Knight with powerful necrotic magic and after finding the statue of a celestial in the Northern biggest tower we were attacked necromancer and his large undead army who entered the tower by a portal. The army turned to dust once we killed the necromancer.  I guess that Dead Knight got some efficient allies/servants but their armies crumble the minute they die.
