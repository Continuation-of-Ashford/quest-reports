**Sons of the Sea**

Xia, Silan, and myself headed to Shea's Wake - this is our group report. Approaching Shea, we made small talk. She said she is the reason everything is peaceful, but she can only protect the peninsula. After inquiry it was revealed that she is an elder dragon. We then got down to brass tacks. She required open minds- she wishes to perform a ritual: a cursed galleon with souls wanders the water that she wishes to put to rest. She described the seance as a way to speak with the dead through a conduit they possessed in life. She then presented a chest and said to take something.  After we each grabbed an object, me a spyglass, Silan a rag, and Xia some shoes, Shea setup a ritual circle. She promised to maintain the magic and keep watch over our bodies. We concentrated on the ritual as the world faded around us and we slipped into what seemed to be a different place. We heard the sounds of the sea and coast, an ancient elven dialect that at first we didn't understand began making sense. We each slipped into the mind of someone who was not us. Xia slipped into the mind of Kai, a master cobbler. On his way to take a ship to another elven city, he stopped at a fountain that was known to give good luck when prayed at. Behind him, someone named Dheneva, a wood elf from a human village. Her pet rat Edgar is her one and only friend in life. She dreams of settling down and living a peaceful life with Edgar in the countryside. Kai and Dheneva walked to the end of the dock, where a group of people waited, led by the captain of the ship. Next to him was Lila, his first mate. Kai had been told he could gain free passage for helping with fishing, but others knew that they were hunting for a sea monster - for a hefty reward. Taken aback, Kai resolved himself to board anyways as he was pressed for time to get to his destination. The ship the captain owned was clearly the vessel of a sea monster hunter. However, he seems to lack an able-bodied crew - that would be why many well-armed mercenaries were assembled at the docks. After a brief rallying speech, we set off. Our memories sped through the night and into the day as Captain Lescar, the leader of the Horizon Chaser, addressed the crew. Kai, Lila and Dheneva became fast friends during the voyage.  On the way to an all-hands meeting, Lila was tasked with retrieving a report from the watch. She was informed that all is well and returned to the captain and the meeting.

Sea wyrms can become enormous and live for millennia: therefore, the captain takes it upon himself to hunt them while they are young and can still be dealt with. He went on to recount his experiences as a young man where his father did the same thing. Of course, bad things happen, and one day his father never returned. He has reason to believe that this is also the wyrm that took out his father's vessel. He noted that although a Kraken took out most of his crew on his previous job, they got the job done. The plan was simple: upon finding the beast, we are to use the four magical harpoons on the ship to ensnare the creature and bring it to the bow, where we can then slaughter the creature. We split up into groups and completed various tasks about the boat. A few hours (and shoe puns) later and suddenly mist began blanketing the boat. We were upon the monster. The harpoons were manned and fired, all four finding their target. With a roar it fell back into the water and combat ensued as those on the harpoons wrestled to get it out of the water. The battle was fierce and, although the monster was slain, we were dragged into the depths with it. After death we became wraiths by some supernatural being and our old wills replaced by the wrath of the being  who resurrected us. Our memories were a blur and time seemed translucent. Many battles and much death throughout. Eventually we found ourselves at the next target, Port Red Key. Then, our vision returned. Our final vision had been the future instead of the past.
