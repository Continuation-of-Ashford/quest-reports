**Powerful Investors**

&nbsp;

I was tasked today with meeting investors for the Grinning Dragons, I brought my two most trusted advisers, Quill and Shin-Chi. The investors were not to my taste but I'm sure they have a place in this world. We spoke back and forward for a while before calling on an old Friend. After we spoke for a while the old friend agreed form a guild within the Iredrop ||Smugglers Den||.
