*Calindal's Journal*

&nbsp;

Days after our fateful meeting with the disciples of the White Rod, those fiendish followers of Loviatar, I rest upon the campfire and look at the canvas above me, full of stars. Having lost my voice, I have lost my way of communion with the world, and my prayers will always be silent and turned by the wheel. In my time of endless mourn, I looked at Cairnas. Like any true brother, he stuck by me. And as I looked at him I saw he wanted to speak, and he gave me a great gift. And I realized that my mourning is temporary, like all things that walk beneath the gods.

&nbsp;

I asked my friends on the direction of our next journey. Gwyneth gave us a portent; north. The night passed calmly, and we headed there, through the savannah and arid land. We happened upon a building which Cairnas and Silan tried to examine, but they found no reference as to its origin. And when we moved further, it disappeared from sight. The Weave is truly erratic here.

&nbsp;

Later in our journey, we received another portent from an augury that Gwyneth performed. The Watcher of Souls bids us to walk through the mountains. Faith guides Gwyn more than anyone I've known. I mourn, for as a soldier, I will never know such a connection to the gods. I am merely a canvas for a painting to be sold; she is their brush. 

&nbsp;

After hours of trekking and flying atop my steed, we found a lake that stretched far, a valley that felt calm and peaceful. Two towers in the distance, one closer to us than the other, both ancient and magical. An elderly man, sitting on the shore not far from us at all. I approach him, and he disappears. I look back to see no reaction, and I open my eyes to the soft ringing of pure radiance. A celestial was enveloping this place. I wanted to reach it so much, I wanted to speak, to tell it I'm there. Alas, I could only sense and not see. Gwyneth saw right away, and spoke with the celestial. I could only guess what they said. I mourn my lack of connection strongly there. The mourning was replaced by curiosity as a boat appeared from nowhere, carrying with it a sleeping, strange elf, covered in rags. Cairnas brought it to shore. I reached out to lay my hand upon them, but in a moment of agony and cold that wanted to swallow the warmth I offered, I tried to cleanse her. She awoke, speaking high Elvish, oblivious to the land, to the time, and to the place, but she knew her name; Faelyn. Silan and Cairnas spoke of maps and directions. They share these thoughts with me. Faelyn gives us her trinkets, incredible items at further glance. Her bow is very interesting, and exotic. Her dexterity is that of an expert archer, the expertise I know that people like Wally are capable of. Gwyneth has a pure moment of peace, a hand of the celestial laid on her pauldron, blessed by fading life. Perhaps more than anything, she has met hers. It gives me more hope, and more strength to carry on my crusade.

&nbsp;

We proceed to the closer tower of the two to explore it. Faelyn has a moment of darkness, panic rising, and this is where my entry will end. More things are to come; May the Watcher of Souls guide me.
