**From Rock bottom to down to Earth**

&nbsp;

So for the past few months I have had something on my mind, and slowly I was working towards it. A few people here and there knew and helped me or would be on the look out for me. Then after a while as some might know I was testing and experimenting in Moonrest and I was working on something big. Unfortunately that didn't pan out, and I felt defeated as if I had hit rock bottom.

But luckily with the help of my friends here in Moonrest I got some new motivation. Cue to where this quest starts off. I had asked some friends and companions with whom I had all worked before to visit and strategies with me. But once everyone arrived and I started talking about my goal, a raven appeared, with a message addressed to me. It was from an old friend of mine, Joaqin, whom I had met in Kasr shortly after arriving in the region. He heard a few months ago what I was working on and found something he thought might help. He was, however, a bit sparse on the details of where you actually find it besides in the underdark. Or where to find him for that matter, since he is supposed to work near there. Luckily he spoke about a very friendly lady that works in Dead Man's Post from whom he first heard of the location to get his work. Finding the lady wasn't the hardest part, and she remembered Joaqin. She told us about where she came from, Wolfsvale, and how to get there.

When we finally got to the city near the river in the underdark (travel was not very interesting, we saved some lady out at sea, bought some items in the underdark, etc) the lord of the area had instantly send some peacekeepers to take us to him. Seemed well enough since we wanted to talk to him anyway for a deal for the stone that I am looking for. Conversation went fine, and we made the deal that if we help him, we get the stone. The reason for this is that the stone is still in the mine, and the mine was overrun by creatures that are half spider and half drow. Basically, unlikable creatures called Driders. We would meet Joaqin at the entrance of the mine at his camp. So after following the river towards the mine (and finding a canoe that fits in your bag), I finally see Joaqin again after all this time. Long story short, he tells us where to go and what he knows about the enemy. Large number of driders including spellcasters.

We entered the mine, got attacked by some wildlife there, cloakers to be more specific, and we started exploring the nearby area. My servitor, an Earth Elemental, got unlucky however and burrowed his way right into a sticky trap on top of a pillar. But as luck would have it, multiple companions were on a similar level on other pillars, and were able to hop, skip and jump from pillar to pillar to help. I had to teleport myself up since I was still down in the water. Although we managed to win the fight well enough, my Earth Elemental took the brunt of the hits so I am gonna have to really take care of him soon. A few of them tried to escape to warn the nest, but we were lucky that we stopped that from happening. We did decide that, before we continue, we head back to camp to rest and plan, since they might have more traps prepared for us. So this is where we currently stand, and I am sending this report from deep down below.
