# Dagnal Ungart's Revenge
A certain dwarf from Thromdur's shoulder on Balto Island is completely done with the Drow on Balto that have enacted biological warfare on the Dwarven kingdom there and cost him his livelihood and ruined his honor. He is offering a decent sum of gold to adventurers in Port Redkey to assist him in his secret plan for settling his grudges.  But the posting leaves you to wonder... Is this Dwarf's secret plan actually a good idea? If he did lose his livelihood to the Drow, does that mean the money he offering is all of his life's savings?  ((6 players max - insert Black Friday joke here ))
