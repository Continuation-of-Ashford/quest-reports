# Unwanted Inheritance
For the past week your dreams have turned to horrific nightmares stained by blood and violence. Every night, you have dreamt of the same losing battle, of the same army of demons sweeping over the land and slaughtering all who stand in their wake. Though the battle changes the end remains the same - a horrific creature, holding a banner topped with the heads of your parents, impaling you through the heart. In seeking a remedy for these nightmares, you have found each other in the healing halls of Shea's Wake, when an old crone walks up to you...

So everyone with parents in old Ashford is apparently getting the same series of nightmares that U have been living through since the beginning of the month. Momo aka the daughter of the worth spelljammer owner/inventor of all time, Bastielle and Poppy, the children of team I like making chaotic deals with order obsessed freaks and me, the only of son of mister “did I tell that time I did cost Titivilus and his two brothers that divine diviner soul he wanted so much? Better hope you don’t have troubles with the idiots down there because of me!”. I would feel bad for my 7 sisters but they never get that kind of problems.

&nbsp;

Well, we went to Shea’s new place to help the sick and weak, and the old lady leading that establishment announced that we were **cursed**. My diagnostic was asshole wizard casting that dream spell on us daily, so close enough, I guess there is some hag version (note: find the hag version, if possible in ritual form and without the hag, or worse, nearbu).

&nbsp;

 Okay but how we fix that Old Lady that is totally not hag related? Oh we need to kill the creatures of our dream when you summon them ? Who are you lady? And why do you get so angry when we ask if you are an evil hag? Do you any idea of how many bullshit story of bullshit fights, all setup by idiots trying to profit from them, our parents told us about? Also “it’s probably someone our parents angered”, do you know how little it reduces the list?

So we go to some lone place, the lady does her summoning, some large beast and its “Sheppard from hell” shows up and summon shades and I let the girls deal with the beast while I weaken the flying pile of crap Sheppard who is summoning those shades who could actually kill me quite quickly and there we are, victorious, if a little wounded. 

Then lady “not suspicious” tells us she really needs to go away while we need to stay on the site of the Sheppard’s death, sleeping on it for a few hours. “It’s totally normal, totally natural and not a trap! Why are you so suspicious, where you raised by wolves?” Yeah, darling, I so wish we were.

So of course after a few hours, the real show starts. I suspect the dream creature had to be killed for some plane shift to happen or something of similar qui pro quo magical effect to happen. And look it happened! 

One tiger creature, a Rakshasa I believe it’s called, shows up with two big crystal golems (who resist magic weapon attacks, always a good news). Tony the Tiger with fuckup arms starts ranting about our families being his enemy Viktor’s allies. Hostages, he means. But no apparently RACK TOOL KESH (okay Rak Tulkhesh but tony was licking his little pawns and got a few cat hairs on his tongue), the little brother of SOUL CAT HESH (Sul Khatesh) want us dead or worse. 

So we start running away and mister tony “I can see you when you are invisible” the tigerman tries to plane shift us(well me) to the gods know were (because they actually know the place I guess). We all managed to get away fine. And that asshole tigerman totally don’t know we all live in the biggest towns around. I need to hire a body doubles. Like 10 of them. Pretty sure the tiger will shows up to be one of them.
