# Unwanted Inheritance
For the past week your dreams have turned to horrific nightmares stained by blood and violence. Every night, you have dreamt of the same losing battle, of the same army of demons sweeping over the land and slaughtering all who stand in their wake. Though the battle changes the end remains the same - a horrific creature, holding a banner topped with the heads of your parents, impaling you through the heart. In seeking a remedy for these nightmares, you have found each other in the healing halls of Shea's Wake, when an old crone walks up to you...
