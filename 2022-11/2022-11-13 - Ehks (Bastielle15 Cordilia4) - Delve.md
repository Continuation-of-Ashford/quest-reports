# Quest Report
`Author: Gentleman (Xia 12)`


I once again find myself at Logan's run with an all new party, all of them familiar faces save for a particularly snarky Death Cleric named Cordelia who was abashed by my servants. With pleasantries complete, we quickly made our way to collect the bear token before heading to the ritual room. I advised them not to attack no matter what they saw as I wanted to watch this play out. We saw them carve runes into the whimpering boy James. As the ritual completed we saw the Head druid plunged a dagger into James while another came with a talisman, causing both the talisman and boy to glow. They then extracted his heart, and from a box they produced a gem. They imbedded the green gem into his heart causing him to cry out before replacing the heart in his chest and began consoling James. With that the vision faded. This time the sniffling James confirmed that this was how things happened. In the chest left behind we found a vial and dagger alongside the stick and token. The ritualistic dagger seemed to just be a uncommon dagger, however the vial is a vial of innocence, a rare potion component.

With all the tokens, we descended to the next level. We took a left and ended up in some pseudo-water area. While we could breath our movement was slowed. Well mine was, Asterios and Nox (Transformed into a Snake) could simply swim. My Skeletons also were not hindered so it may just be a me problem. Regardless we encountered some sharks in this area who disappeared into bubbles when defeated and dropped a chest (Though not without more snark from the death cleric). Inside were many shark teeth, a token of the fin, A potion of water breathing and 50 GP. It has the characteristic bearded man, with a shark fin on the other side. The token grants a short term swim speed of a hunter shark when used. After leaving the watery room, we entered yet another one (This time I used freedom of movement, fuck this 'water') and we began fighting some octopus and quippier schools. After a battle well fought we found some leather armor with various fishing adornments, high quality magical ink, 100 GP, and another token, this one with a stylish kraken besetting a ship. We collected the goodies and decided that it was time to leave the watering hole. I tried to haggle for the Squid token however Asterios wanted 5k. Needless to say I refused his stingy request and parted ways with the others. Sadly I fear I'm outgrowing this place quickly. Perhaps I'll sell these tokens to bright eyed adventurers along with the lore I've gathered of this place sometime soon.
