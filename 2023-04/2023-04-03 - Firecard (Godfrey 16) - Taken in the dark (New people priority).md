# Quest Report
`Author: Wafflecopter (Alain 5)`


It's impressive how terribly everything went for our party. Meeting in Port Red Key, we traveled east to meet our source regarding the disappearing people. Unfortunately, we encountered a drow patrol who attacked us. Perhaps they were instigated by some choice comments a comrade made, but I won't rat them out. Regardless, we had to surrender to them. 

&nbsp;

We were taken to a fancy estate of what seems to be some kind of noble drow lady. She instructed us to clear out a duergar encampment for her, claiming there would be our missing people there. Of course, she lied. We wiped out the duergar and found no missing people. The one we interrogated had no recollection of anyone missing.

&nbsp;

Of course, we couldn't leave empty handed. After discovering a hidden trapdoor, we unleashed a golem made of brains that nearly killed us all. We persevered, and four of us entered the trapdoor, hoping to find some kind of reward for our efforts. All we found was a mechanism that opened a purple portal. Obviously, we went through....only to be greeted by a mind flayer. I had never seen one in the flesh before, but the drow noble had shown me the illusion of one. We were all on death's door; our greed had taken us a bit too far. 

&nbsp;

We rushed out of the portal and ran into the underdark. Notably, the two other teammates who did not enter the trapdoor had vanished, along with the noblewoman we were counting on to teleport us out of the Underdark. We ran into some strange monsters and panicked a bit, I think. Again, we were all on death's door. Lucius flew into the recesses of the cavernous ceiling, streaking off into the darkness. The three remaining ran backwards, hoping the mind flayer had stopped chasing us. We took a different path an encountered some mushroom people, who were surprisingly accommodating. They showed us the path to the surface and even escorted us there. This path led to Dead Man's Post. The guards heckled us a bit for being stupid -- as if they could have survived what we did -- and let us to the surface. Thank the Traveler. Of course, I suspect our two teammates who didn't go into the trapdoor abandoned us in hopes of more reward money, but it is also possible that the portal dilated time in some manner. It's impossible to tell down there. 

&nbsp;

On the surface, I used sending to contact Lucius, who had found his own way to the surface via a strange settlement governed by a mirror man (somehow an even more unlikely rescue than our own). I messaged Aldym was well to ensure he knew we were all alive and wanted our cold, hard, currency. All in all -- better than I expected. I rise to face another day tomorrow.
