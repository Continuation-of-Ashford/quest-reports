# Quest Report
`Author: Spartan Scholar (Stowan 3)`


As Stowan arrived on the island his first exposure to the inhabitants was watching Doban chase down Egder and proceed to wrestle around the group in the middle of the adventure's guild. Oddly enough, this behavior was quite amusing and different than what he was exposed to.

&nbsp;

After introductions were made me and the others decided to leave town and deal with a rising of lizard folk near Khozo village, right outside Port Red Key. After an uneventful travel, we decided to make a dual approach to the Khozo Village, myself and the only other who look capable of hiding, Edger, snuck off into the woods to set up an ambush while the others moved into position. 

&nbsp;

Negotiations were very short, the fight started with a roar from Doban while we sprung our trap. Unfortunately our bravado was quickly halted by a cruel lizardfolk shaman decided to cast a plant growth spell that affected even me, a wood elf. As the grass and surrounding wood turned against us, the battle slowed. We eventually were able to best the lizardfolk Monarchs and clear the village of the remaining vermin prior to our return back to Port Red Key.
