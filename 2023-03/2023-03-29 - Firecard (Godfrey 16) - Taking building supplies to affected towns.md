`Author: Wafflecopter (Alain 4)`


We set off to deliver supplies in the morning. A demon was attacking right outside Port Red Key as we left, but we ignored it. The guards had it handled, probably. Traveling quietly, we encountered surprisingly few problems on the road. An owlbear was swiftly dispatched by our gunner, and some marauding sahuagin were laid to rest at the expense of one of the town guard. 

&nbsp;

Of note was an extremely disturbing town. It lay abandoned, save for the eerie sensation. My dragonmark urged me to look closer, and I saw a great number of spectres swirling around. One bore an amulet, and it entreated me to bury it in the town square. Having no desire to be haunted forever, I did as it wished. My reward was some diamond dust found in an old box in the town square. I was eager to leave.

&nbsp;

We reached Four Corners on good time. A stone giant stood in the town, moving boulders around -- seemingly helping with repairs. An odd sight, but he seemed congenial enough. He did mention a "death king" was roaming around, which appears to be a lich giant. Nasty business, I'm sure. After some small talk, we left our supplies and departed. Job well done, as is par for the course for me.
