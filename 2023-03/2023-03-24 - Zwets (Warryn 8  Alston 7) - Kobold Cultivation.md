# Kobold Cultivation
The north most farmlands, out from Dead Man's Post have been sitting empty for a while. These furthest farms were the least protected when demons besieged the kingdom.  A group of kobolds known to live in a mine not too far from there have announced they would like to take over the farm, and can definitely pay taxes if Dead Man's Posts allows them to become it's citizens.  All they need is someone to come and teach them how to farm... at night, because kobolds can barely see during the day. All of the surrounding farmers have slammed their doors and told the kobolds to go away, when asked "to follow a kobold to and abandoned farm at night".  Since the locals are obviously scared of the dark, perhaps a few braver and horticulturally skilled adventurers would be so kind as to turn some small claws into green thumbs.
