# Smuggeling Siege Relief
Port Red Key is beset by demons from the sky, its people are probably hiding in cellars and behind temple walls. It would be foolish for a handful of adventurers to try and take on the demons. But that doesn't mean there's nothing that can be done.  Medicine, food, faith, hope, all the things that citizens under siege desperately need. The criminal gang known as "The Underground", true to their name, has ways into the city that the flying demons have no way of stopping. Merchants and caravaneers that do business with Port Red Key, as well as kind citizens have pooled resources to prepare a relief shipment.  Now what is needed are some brave souls with strong backs and quiet steps to meet up with the smugglers from the Underground and bring those supplies into the city.
