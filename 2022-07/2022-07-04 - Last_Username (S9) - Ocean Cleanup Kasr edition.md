# Ocean Cleanup Kasr edition
The previous adventuring team's attempt to assassinate the Marid has enraged it, causing it to send its storm elemental to wreak even more havoc on the surrounding ocean. As a result, Drowned are encroaching on the islands' shores - adventurers will have to hold off the hordes as long as they are able to. Fortunately, drowned are not the only special deliveries, as the valuable cargo from the ships they once crewed is washing on shore as well.
