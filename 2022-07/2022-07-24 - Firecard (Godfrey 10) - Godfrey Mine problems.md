Burning Minds in a Boring Mine

This story is about a demon, and is a warning for those ill prepared and fool hardy.

&nbsp;

We start with a scene of the caravansary at Dead Man's Post, -center stage- Godfrey. Our heroes enter -stage left-: Buren, Wally, Cairnas, Sha'Ra, Alston, Fjaldar and Flamewing Nackle.

Godfrey rants loudly -but the audience is meant to only understand half of it- the words "MINE" and "NIGHTMARES" are repeated multiple time within the nonsense words.

The ranting is interrupted by even louder screaming as a man falls from the sky. -use stage false floor, place cushions-  the heroes look surprised.

Godfrey: Another day in Dead Man's Post. -musical stinger-

-End Scene-

&nbsp;

Three miners with eye bag makeup enter -stage left- the heroes enter -stage right-.

-cue music-

Miners: The burning man, he won't let us sleep

Heroes: The burning man?

A soot blackened dwarf runs in from -stage right-

Dwarf: The burning man!

Heroes: The burning man?

Miners: The burning man, is buried deep

Heroes: The burning man?

Dwarf: The burning man!!

-The soot dwarf lifts a comically oversized unlit torch-

Miners: He's some nightmare causing creep

Heroes: The burning man?

Dwarf: -exuberant- THE BURNING MAN!

-Stagehand in the downstage prompter lights comical torch-

Miners: The burning man, is buried deep

Heroes: The burning man?

Dwarf: THE BUURNING MAAN!! FOR YOU I SHALL REAP!!

Dwarf chases the miners with the torch, -exit stage left-

The miners and the dwarf re-enter -stage left-

Miners & dwarf: SKELETONS IN THE DEEP, BEWARE THE PRICE IS STEEP!!

The miners and the dwarf run -exit stage right- Be sure to have a water bucket there to extinguish torch

-End Scene-

Curtain on mine scene. Use gray sheets to represent stone ceiling, convey an enclosed space

-Heroes enter stage right, use spotlight on them as only scene light to darken rest of scene- 

Heroes draw they weapons and appear on guard.

-Burning man enters from downstage- 

Burning man: You feeble fools! Now you have entered my domain!

All heroes except Cairnas and Alston begin smoking from the neck and turn their weapons upon the 2.

Alston and Cairnas turn to Wally and Fjaldar, with a heartened plea and magic to return their allies to their senses.

&nbsp;

2 teams for 4 now. The Burning Man, Buren, Sha'Ra and Flamewing, clash with Cairnas, Wally, Fjaldar and Alston. 

Burning man -stands center stage-: YOU ARE WORTHLESS!

The burning man uses magic -deploy smoke on stage-

Smoke clears, everyone but Cairnas, Fjaldar and the burning man is on the ground.

&nbsp;

Cairnas: Sha'Ra! Alston! -kneels down to their fallen allies-

Burning man strikes Cairnas in the back, but Cairnas does not fall

Fjaldar finally lands a blow on the burning man.

Burning man: Screams -deploy smoke center stage- burning man exits -downstage-

Heroes: We are never hunting demons again!

&nbsp;

-The End-
