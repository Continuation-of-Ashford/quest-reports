Bulette business

&nbsp;

So in case anyone is still interested in what we did awhile ago I just happened to walk past the post so I decided to share a short report of it.

We heard a mine had some trouble so we collected some people and set out to help them.

During our travels we found a shrine to something. gave us some luck apparently, but besides that our travel was normal. 

When we arrived we talked with the foreman who basically just send us in to help them get rid of whatever creature there might have been.

&nbsp;

Very early on we found 2 young Bulettes, and after a strange loud sound of which I have no idea how that happened we attracted a couple more young ones, and an adult one.

While me and Fjaldar kept hitting them the other scared casters just ran away while I protected them (this is why focusing on stonework is best as a mage, so you don't have to run away after getting hit once, but instead you can just stand your ground).

&nbsp;

Anyway, all was good, they weren't nice to us so we weren't nice to them.

We seemed to have gotten most of them, but just to be sure we checked out the rest of the mine (or at least the parts we could access as a group).

We indeed found 1 big stray, but with me in the lead (and some others chasing a mystery man instead) we managed to clear the whole mine. 

Looked like a good mine as well!
