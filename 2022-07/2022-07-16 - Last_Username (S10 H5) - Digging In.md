Nashena writes in a journal as being of immense age can tend to mess with the mind even of ones as great as the gith-yanki. "First Merrick sends us to fetch weapons to ward off this pesky dragon that keeps coming about. That was surprisingly not the worst part of this lowly mission. The worst was dealing with that large auntie who refuses to use words instead of violence. Upon arriving at the drawven keep we were met with a weary door guard. They told us the king was likely to agree to lend us the weapons if we helped with a small problem they were having. At first it appeared that I had found an illithid strong hold but alas a quick bisection of a fallen diseased dwarf proved that was in fact not what we were fighting. The members of the party did well fighting the poor creatures. In the end we did manage to secure the cannons from the dwarves. One member I forget their name, although they were interesting to talk with, had even figured the source of the suffering. The king though sorrowful for the loss of his people was grateful that there was now a course to destroy the creature turning his people and we were set off with weapons for facing the dragon."
