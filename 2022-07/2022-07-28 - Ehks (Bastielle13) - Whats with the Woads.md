What's with the Woad's

Weird tree creatures ran into town pulling on people arm.

Violet was able to communicate in sylvan with the woads and learn that they wanted us to follow to Logan's old grove 

Unusual that no animal sounds or tracks about a mile out of Logan's run.

The druid's grave was swollen and had what looks to be a cave being formed. Red and yellow light seemed to almost glow from the grave. The woads began to get scared when the party began ritual casting.

A tree seemed to glow with nature magic and evil Wood Woads appeared!

After slaying the three evil woads, one of the good wood woads ran off into the dungeon causing the party to follow quickly. 

After scouting and walking around a vast dungeon we lost one of our small woad friends in the confusing maze. We found ourselves surrounded by the evil woads. We faked our surrender (then we found one of the small woads bodies beaten brutally to death) and started leaving before I, Clamtip turned around and sprayed most of them with ice, which started a big fight. killed all but one enemies.

We took a short rest.

We went in and found a semi-transparent Logan and a glowing crystal that almost seemed to beat almost like a heart. It was unable to be moved. 

After trying with all our might to push the crystal off and Logan talking to us for a little bit the rest of the monsters in the dungeon showed up to beat us in. 

Surviving the fight we went on to search the entire dungeon finding a magical focus and not much else. I, Clamtip realized we might need access to a spell that none of our party had access to. BRING A CLERIC ABLE TO CAST AT LEASE LESSER RESTORATION IN ANY RETURN TRIPS!!!
