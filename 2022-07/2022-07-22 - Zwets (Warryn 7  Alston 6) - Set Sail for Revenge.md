# Set Sail for Revenge
After being freed from the Marid, Felosial the Siren really wants revenge.  She's to do her worst and is bargaining with the Kasr village elders for the Dwarven cannons.  The Siren needs some help from adventurers, with her plan. If she can really deliver on the promise of an unsinkable warship, you could take the fight to the enemy. That would certainly beat waiting to see who gets attacked first.
