The vile dragon Briez returned to Kasr village with vengeance in his heart.  Humiliated by his defeat in his lair, he descended upon the village with intent to raze it once more.  Na'Kinta, brave but foolish, led the dragon away from her companions to duel it herself.  The dragon responded by releasing the clockwork dragonling it had stolen from Poppy, but this time to fight alongside it.  It swooped down to Na'Kinta and quickly rendered her unconscious.  Rearing back towards the rest of the village, it was distracted by annoying owls and badgers and wolves.  Meanwhile, Tabasnos, Wally, Nicky, and Morbius worked to quickly bind then destroy the fragile dragonling.

The dragon let loose a terrifying roar as it returned to the village proper.  Fjaldar and Logan worked to distract it to lure it closer to the ground.  Once in reach, Logan shifted into a massive octopus and ensnared it in his tentacles to drag it into the ground.  The grounded dragon proved easy prey for the dwarven cannons and Fjaldarâ€™s blade.  The day was not yet won, as in a final act of retribution, it breathed its lightning breath and slew Logan.

As all the adventurers worked in tandem to bring the dragon down, Fjaldar hit the killing blow and took its head as a prize.
