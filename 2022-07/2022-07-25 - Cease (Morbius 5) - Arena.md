Through the Strange Doorway

&nbsp;

A swirling vortex of planar energy whisked away our heroes. The teleported into an arena filled with all manner otherworldly creatures, sand, and shark filled pools. A wizard of tremendous power announced the heroes arrival is various tongues before summoning multiple undead creatures. The heroes were initially taken aback by the forces arrayed against them: mummies, an undead t-rex, a beholder zombie, and an alhoon. However, the fight quickly tuned in the favor of the heroes and they unleashed devastating magic and arms against the undead creatures. Quickly, the corpses of the undead lay at the feet of the heroes, who took barely even a scratch. Victory and gold in hand, the heroes were shuttled away back to their home plane.
