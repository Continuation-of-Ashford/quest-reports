# Quest Report

I learned one thing early in my days here in Kasr, an' that was that bards and dragons should not mix. So, I found myself wondering what I was doing on a mission to slay a dragon. Slay, a dragon. By the gods I'm insane. 

The group this evenin' consisted of Poppy, Bastille, Gilly, Junior, Yoyo, Shroud, and yours truly

We'd found a group of 'Friendly' fire giants who'd fashioned dragon slaying weapons for the  group. Then pretty much tossed us out by the way of staring ut us quite angrily until we left. They seemed to want the dragon gone as much as we did. But not so much that they wanted to join us on the hunt.

&nbsp;

One climb later, we found the volcanic lair of the lizard. It was guarded by.. well. Fire giants and they didn't quite fall for my negotiating tactics. But they were handily defeated by the group. We stumbled on some of the Azer and the group sought fit to try and negotiate a second time. Which i found a bit silly, and I think the Azer did too because they sounded the alarm horn in their faces and we had another scuffle on our hands.

&nbsp;

We persevered of course, since I'm writing this letter, and we found part of our goal for this mission. 'Mac' had been held in the dragons dungeons ever since its first raid on Kasr. And the poor bloke looked pretty damn exhausted. We had a brief chat, fought some more sentries, and then sent him on his way back. Didn't like sendin' him back alone. But we had a secondary target and he was in no shape to scuffle with it.

&nbsp;

Now. the dragon was a fair bit of a fuckup of a fight, no-one decided to use the -dragon-slaying- gear very soon, which woulda been a boon. But, it was a bit of a clusterfluffle of a figt so I can't really blame anyone. I shoulda floated one of the wielders sooner. An' . We sadly realized the lizard was a slippery bastard.. I mighta hit it once, an' no more.  Next time, I need to be more prepared.. make it easier to hit, or make myself more accurate.

I'd say all in all, we did our best, we had the thing on the ropes. I'd chugged tha' potion of Polymorph I've held on to for months now to block its way out.. which, well. Was when it got out anyways. Teleportation. an' He stole Tink from Poppy.. I mean, stealing  a bunch of gold and gear from the oldtimers on the island? That I can let slip, but when he steals from my close ones.. Then we got ourselves a bloody vendetta on our hands.

&nbsp;

.. well that, an' we now still have to keep an eye on the sky to remain safe. But at the very least, we've dealt with one lair of this thing.. hopefully it doesn't have many others. I'll need to talk to Mac I guess, see if he knows of any other hideyholes the blue bastard might have.
