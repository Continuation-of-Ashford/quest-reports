# Quest Report
`Author: Ignore Me (J12 A8 T5)`


So the Marid sent his elemental army to trash my pretty little city on the coast. 5000 GP in damage and a few weeks of repair should allow us to make the place looks like it never happened. Many thanks to the people who fought for the city: Fjaldar, Poppy, Cairnas, Felix and of course our new ally Lord Godfrey of Dead Man Post and his courageous guards(who did sacrifice their life to protect our city). Special thanks to the watch guard members who risked their life to help us as best as they could, I know most of them were still in training.

On a tactical level, Poppy proved to everyone that the Wind Wall spell is indeed quite efficient at neutralizing the storm elemental ability to move. We also confirmed that the whole army will just run off when the storm elemental dies. I guess we will have to repeat the process a few times in other city, before being able to go on a sea trip and get rid of that idiotic Marid once and for all in his water palace.
