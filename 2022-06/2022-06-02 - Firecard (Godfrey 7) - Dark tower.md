"I conducted my preliminary introductions finally with others today. A female drow halfing....and other races mixed in....that also used to be a man- that calls herself 'Bastiellle'/ A half-elf, and devout worshipper of what she referred to as a lesser deity- named 'Gwyneth Evermore'/ A....well I am not quite sure, he did not say what he was or what his occupation was, but his surface thoughts were simple dance timing ques on repeat- named 'Felix'/ A  gaudy chauvinist by the name of 'Godfrey"...who proclaimed himself Great, but I am unsure as to what makes him great/ And finally a quite half elf, that closed his mind off to me, but surface thoughts were primal....his greed was quite strong- only referred to as 'Junior'.

&nbsp;

These individuals, along with myself, agreed to respond to what the villagers discerned as a threat- a high elf scientist that utilized his intellect to make many creatures- via grafting, splicing with other organics- or even breeding.....I did not see the inherent threat once we finally met this individual and I was allowed time to speak with him. His scientific progression far surpasses much of what I have sought to explore- I may need to take time to visit this individual again if he would have me...his notes would be quite the boon to further my own study of the metaphysical through understanding organic and even genetic makeup...

&nbsp;

Nevertheless- he agreed to lessen the 'threats' he was manufacturing, and even reward us with monetary gain if we assisted him in cleaning up fail experiments of his. Even going a step further to offer the half elf assistance to deal with his unwelcomed guest growing in his arm.

&nbsp;

We traveled deeper into his compound and fought these creatures...I am assuming these were abominations, at least from the fear and surface thoughts of the others around me- I would not have turned to violence if they had not attacked us though. We fought many, and fell many. Godfrey lack of mental fortitude quickly became apparent as it seemed every mind bending technique these creatures utilized was hyper effective against him. He did not die- but was close to death a few times. But rest assured, I do not believe his mental capacity was harmed, as I am unsure ones mental capacity can dip quite as low without suffering Ego Death. I myself also came close to meeting my demise, through more conventional means though as one of the creatures utilized an effective bludgeoning attack against me. Bastielle was able to revive me however, which reminds me- I must thank her for these efforts at a later time. 

&nbsp;

Overall we were successful in felling all creatures, and were rewarded in turn for our efforts. I look forward to my possible examinations of Gwyn as she did not seem averted to assisting me in furthering my studies- and also speaking again with this scientist- maybe he can assist me with further exploration of my own mind and being through more intrusive means..."
