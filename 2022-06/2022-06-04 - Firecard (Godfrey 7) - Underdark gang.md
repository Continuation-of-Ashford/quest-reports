`Author: Zwets (Warryn 6 | Alston 5)`


(The following text is encoded with a cypher, but a simple Comprehend Languages easily fixes that)

&nbsp;

-This is Warryn Nibler reluctantly writing you.-

-Compelled to supply you information.-

-Currently located on Toril. The Farashad Islands. Port Red Key.-

&nbsp;

-I have made contact with a local criminal organization, calling themselves "The Underground".-

-Their leader a female Drow who was referred to as "Her who's name has been forgotten".-

&nbsp;

-A competing thieves guild from the city of "Waterdeep", has expended funding to construct a local stronghold.-

-These newcomers are an offshoot of "Xanathar's Guild", and a human named "Eric" leads this incursion.-

-"~Forgotten" gave us a map of her rival's establishment, and requested we 'cause and accident' there.-

-Transported individuals Thalim, Jo'jo, Asterios, Vulluin, Zhax, Michaud and me agreed to engage in this subterfuge.-

&nbsp;

-We waited till nightfall and lit a fire on the work floor, near the boilers. This caused Eric and his goons to run out the front.-

-We engaged them in combat and it was a tough fight. Waterdeep seems to have a source of high quality henchmen.-

-Once I'd slain Eric and the others murked his 2 wizard lieutenants, the rest of the hired goons made a fighting retreat.-

&nbsp;

-I intend to acquire further contacts within the local criminal organization, they may prove useful in the future.-

&nbsp;

-Hope this missive never finds you-
