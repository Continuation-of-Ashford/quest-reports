# Quest Report
`Author: Ignore Me (J9 A6)`


**Hi, i am the public writer for the village of Kasr and a giant Minautor named Asterios threatened to kill if i didn't write this report addressed to you. Can you tell him to stop threatening my life every time he needs something written? Also some money for my work would be nice!!! He refuses to tip! Anyway, this is the most faithful reproduction of what he wanted me to write to you: **

Asterios here, littleman, so you better write good. The mission: find a couple. One human woooooman, one half-elfman. Lost in the mountains. Black tower hunting. We go to mountains and met a flaming skeleton on our way. We passed by him, big armor, lot of flames. Wolfbearman talks to him. He doesn’t want to fight. He is on big fire. All his body.  Wolfbearman,  catmage, catcarryingman, bossman and elfman didn’t want to fight so I don’t want either. Keep walking. Met lying merchant again. Didn’t ask us for money for his lies this time. Told us the place lost couple searched was full if snow trolls, who look blurry and hard to kill. Sell potions for too much money. Pass. Catmage got scammed.  We keeps walking.  Makes camp and four flying dragons-not-dragons attacked us while asleep, no armor. Elfman wake us up. Me smart,  so me chained one in fire runes, and elfman and ME killed it. The 2? No, 1- no *(long pause)* 5! *(public writer’s note: I think, he meant 3)* The FIVE *(three)* remaining ones flew away like coward. Elfman get poison from corpse. Then we was in the mountains searching for couple. Found a lot of blood near empty camp. Heard lot of singing in nearby cave, wolf-bearman dragged us there. Entered the cave. Was dark. I see we closed eye. Moved silently. Spotted women alone, crying. Elfman in armor of silence took her and carried her away. She kept crying. We spot snow trolls. We exit cave, walk back to Kasr and now I am paid- AND NO, NO MONEY FOR YOU WRITINGMAN!!! MONEY IS FOR WHORE AND I DIDN’T- *(public writer’s note: I stopped writing there. I am paid by the village council for that job, but it’s common for the client to tip. Can you explain it to him?)*
