# Second Half of the Road to Forthyr
Though some voices in the village confidently say the road south was a bad idea. Alston will not let those fearful of change stop the wheels of PROGRESS!  It took many days of preaching and pleading, but he has finally requited some enough villagers from Kasr to help him finish the road to Forthyr.  He needs the help of some adventurers to scout the path and protect the workers. A reward will be given to adventurers that can aid him in this endeavor.
