# The Butcher's Return
The activities of the Butcher's Circus have seen them run out of Dead Man's Post, but their caravan still makes rounds about Balto Island, drawing viewers from smaller settlements and villages surrounding the island. A scarred man calling himself the Jester is offering a bounty for anyone who can investigate the caravan and discover if the banishment of The Butcher has tempered their activities or if the corruption runs deeper.

The Butcher's Return

&nbsp;

So there we were, me, a giant, a goblin fellow called Meeks, i didnt know they made creatures that small... and Edgar too, we were tasked by a jester to investigate the butchers circus, apparently it had reappeared after it has been banished some time ago, we were tasked to see if they were "evil"

&nbsp;

so we set out, i bought an elephant...which now that i think about it is still there...probably works for the circus now.. poor guy.. he has a cool red saddle though. (courtesy of me and some red paint i found at my feet). Meeks bought a horse to travel and Edgar rode on a broom! that was cool!

&nbsp;

when we arrived we were met by a clown, who introduced us to that carnival along with a whole bunch of carnival games, including my favorite, HIT THE THINGI WITH THE HAMMER!!! which obviously i was amazing at, hammers being my whole thing you know. But i won a plushie of a dinosaur,

and while edgar was out investigating the giant tent, and saw that some animals were being mistreated. we saw that there was a child crying to his father about a chipped tooth he got from an apple bobbing attraction, apparently the apples were made of gold... so no wonder his tooth got chipped. But to cheer the lil guy up, i gave him the plushie i won. and then as we were talkin' the lil kid say something odd;

&nbsp;

according to his father he had 'daydreamed' seeing a guy walk into a tent with a clown, and then only the clown coming out with a bloody knife in his hand...

hearing this i had to use tell them to get out.. couldnt see the lil guy getting hurt.

&nbsp;

Me and Meeks went to the tent the kid pointed to, it turned out to be a knife throwing show! i was completely mesmerized by it! magically so even! it turned out to be a charm! and as we went out to regroup, we knew we had to evacuate the other people. So we did just that!

&nbsp;

As Edgar was on the other side of the carnival bribing people to leave the carnival for hundreds of gold coins, a surprising good tactic, We were deceived some other commoners to leave, saying they were closing. And one of the workers was fooled too.. So they went into a sloppily built wagon and as they entered, we spotted through the door piles of dead bodies... So calling into action, i noticed the door was flimsy, so i grabbed the worker by his throat THROUGH the door.. haha doban thinks this was fun!.. anyway the leader saw so we quickly tied him up and all hell broke loose!

&nbsp;

Seeing as we were about to be attacked, i decided to get some help from the caged animals, I was forced to use my Blessing of Obheron to talk to them, its gone now but im mostly sure it saved us in the long run. With the blessing i was able to talk to the animals and rally them to fight against their oppressors!

&nbsp;

Edgar was being a rouge, throwing Soul Knifes from afar and dodging attacks, Meeks Spent his time Buffing and us and helping the animals get out of the cages,

&nbsp;

And then Edgar was about to be hit in the head with a knife... so feeling the need to save him, i used my runic knowledge for the dagger to hit one of the workers instead...he exploded into smithereens...

Only for Edgar to be THEN hit by an even MORE powerful Dagger Throw!!!! which was a severe hit!

&nbsp;

The madness continued and toward the end i found myself surrounded... i knew there was no escape, but as the master of ceremonies was right there...* I WAS GOING TO TAKE HIM DOWN WITH ME. * And so i fell in a blaze of glory, like a true warrior...i had met death.

But that wasnt the end. Moments later i reawoke seeing my goblin friend crush precious diamonds over my body, he had brought me back. i am thankful to him.

&nbsp;

But as i did, it was time to run. our mission wasnt to destroy the circus, it was to investigate. and yes. they were evil.

so escape we did, marginally, and here i am now telling the tale.
