# The Butcher's Return
The activities of the Butcher's Circus have seen them run out of Dead Man's Post, but their caravan still makes rounds about Balto Island, drawing viewers from smaller settlements and villages surrounding the island. A scarred man calling himself the Jester is offering a bounty for anyone who can investigate the caravan and discover if the banishment of The Butcher has tempered their activities or if the corruption runs deeper.
