`Author: aaazzzrrr (Calindal 18, H11)`


Something terrible is stalking the city of Port Red Key. A creature that steals your memories, and perverts them. A creature that eludes divination, and all magic. A creature that preys on the citizens of the city as a predator.

&nbsp;

I, Hiderion Moonsinger, failed to find such a creature, using all of my resources and magical knowledge. My party has searched for any clues possible, the locations of people that went missing, loved ones left behind that still held their memory. All of them died. All of them fell prey to a creature known as the *false hydra.* What little trails we found were swiftly extinguished and lead to nowhere. We wandered the city looking for as much as we could. The information I could observe from the creature's modus operandi is that it perverts creatures' perception of itself, even memories, so that it may always remain hidden, singing its song. When it can, it lures a victim to it through alleyways, and no trace is left. We know not where it resides. I know how it looks as well. Likely an aberration, a hideous face, sickly pale flesh. Scrying for it using its likeness yielded a perversion of my memories, on Quethyr. An illogical thing, and certainly a roadblock in my plans.

&nbsp;

My companions gleamed little as well. We simply followed trails that either went cold or went nowhere. It came to a point where we found ourselves speaking in the Intelligentsia headquarters with Gilbert about the nature of this problem, with me going mad with my ineptitude. I'm sorry to say that no clear answer was found, and we were still shooting into the dark. When we left, however, we saw something strange. And that same thing deserves another entry.
