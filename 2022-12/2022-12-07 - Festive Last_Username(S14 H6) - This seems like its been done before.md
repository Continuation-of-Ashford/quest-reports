# This seems like it's been done before
Weary of the mask that appears has possessed Shroud on multiple occasions, Bast and Shroud have decided that the best course of action would be to destroy the thing via volcano. The nearest active volcano is unfortunately several miles through hostile giant territory, so Shroud is willing to hire some other adventurers to escort them.

`Author: Gentleman (Xia 15)`


Shroud asked us to assist her in destroying a mask that has been plaguing her for quite a while. Apparently it had the ability to posess those who wore it, and I was given multiple stories from the other adventurers who gathered about it's antics, including tossing people about and causing them to speak in a supernatural voice not all their own. After gathering at Port Red Key, I was introduced to the people I had not met (unfortunately the warlock, Bastielle, didn't take kindly to my undead or my god of choice). After deciding how we would go about traveling to the destination in question as well as a bit of divine sensing from Calindal to further discern the nature of the mask, we began the treck to a volcano North-West of Port Red Key. Along the way we ran into some wyverns over a precariously richety bridge that crossed a chasm and took them out without much issue with multiple falling the few hundred or so feet to their demise. Further along we came across a some sort of dwarven tomb guarded by Fire giants (I think, it was not all explained to me) and the location of the volcano's mouth within. Due to a cease-fire, however, we did not have to fight them. If we did, I'm sure it would have ben slightly harrowing as they used some odd exploding javelin to murder my familiar!  We quickly made our way to the mouth of the volcano after speaking with them and, before casting it into the volcano, Calindal decided to use his lantern of revealing. Upon activation it showed that a spirit-like gem dragonborn figure loomed around the mask. As we attempted to strike it he laughed and stared at us. Upon casting it into the volcano, the mask broke and the "spirit" solidified into who we now know to be Vex Phex. A brief conversation ensued where he claimed to have slain Balthazaar and that he was "Trapped in this game, were even the gods are simply pawns." We then did battle with this projection of him, or so we assumed, as after defeating it we got the sense that it wasn't the real him. Unfortunately my guildmate Shroud had fallen into a catatonic state after our resident paladin cast the mask into the volcano, and even a greater restoration would not rouse her. We decided to deposit her at Shea's Wake with the dragon there (who seemed to be much more hostile to me than last time!) and with that we went our separate ways.
