Hiderion's Journal - Revival

&nbsp;

We set off on our journey, following a portent that Gwyneth and Kadri received from Naralis Analor, elven lord of life and death. We found ruins of the High Elven empire, including an automaton that responded to me as if I was an "aristocrat." Couldn't use it as a servant after further investigation, and shamefully we had to dissassemble it.

&nbsp;

Then, we met upon an ornate, high technology circle. It turned out to be a teleportation circle, that siphoned our life force. Except for Kadri's. Perhaps his dhampir nature made it so he was immune. He cast Dawn on himself, and opened the portal. He became bathed in light and disappeared, and a moment later came back more alive. That is about all I could write of this occassion.
