# Quest Report
`Author: Gentleman (Xia 15)`


We were been called to Dead Man's Post to take out the mind flayer's once and for all. We had been given the greater bag of holding for the bomb and Godfrey has dispatched a small army to occupy most of the Mind Flayer's whilst we infiltrate their base. The password to activate the bomb was "Bipity Bopity Boop" and the deactivation "???" We prepared before running into the base bashing down the front door with a firebolt. Throughout the place we encountered various types of mind flayers, some who were even immune to their blasts allowing them to fire upon some of their allies without worry. They had many slaves who they could summon, including hill giants, crossbowmen, clerics, and berserkers as reinforcements who also gave us trouble. As we slashed our way through their base we came across pods filled with the captured, but as we learned later they were already infected. After healing and freeing one man we came across a room with coffins in it that the mind flayers seemed afraid to let out whoever was inside.

&nbsp;

In the room, we released a half-elf woman from the harper's guild and man from the age of the floating cities, a member of the Nerithil empire. After speaking with him for a while we discovered he didn't gel with their ideology and was labeled a heretic. After sending the harper lady to somewhere safe he returned and assisted us with defeating the mind flayers. The elder brain beyond the teleporter gave us quite the challenge as it too could summon reinforcements as well as this powerful projection that could posses people and transport through other's minds, however we were able to overcome it and it's minions before collecting some of it's brain matter. We then planted the bomb and escaped using Felix's helm of teleportation. A job well done.
