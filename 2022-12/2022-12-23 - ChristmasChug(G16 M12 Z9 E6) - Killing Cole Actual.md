**Centaur saviour**

&nbsp;

I bring you good tidings for I, Cairnas Cephas, have helped destroy Cole and removed the undead blight that pestered the centaur lands.

&nbsp;

I set out with some companions and after travelling for some time we met up with Tess, leader of the centaur horde, and a few of her warriors. We continued as a group, looking to find Cole after all this time, as to reclaim these lands for its original occupants that are still breathing. 

&nbsp;

And we found him, and his undead following, at an old crash site of meteor. Do not worry, for I have collected samples, as can be expected of anyone with a mind like me. Even the seeming dangers of battle do not worry me nor stop me from following that which I dedicate my life to.

&nbsp;

But while travelling through these parts, we noticed many eyes upon us, ever just out of sight in a banked mist around us. But at once Cole appeared, spoke and then left us, to enter a hall, while his minions started an attack on us. 

&nbsp;

Valiantly I told the group that I would defend their backs while they could go after Cole, and so I charged in, with my servitor beside me. And soon the group did run after Cole, leaving only me and Tess' warriors outside. However I quickly realized that they would be doomed were I not to go after them to fight Cole myself, and so with speed I allowed me and my servitor to follow the group, putting faith in the hardy hearts of our new comrade centaur.

&nbsp;

And as we entered, Cole was waiting, with help, and as I charged in head first, he summoned dragons that lay to rest, for this is their tomb, and they attacked us. But I managed to pass, and reached Cole first, and hit him with all my might. All the while trying to defend the group, for I tried to stop the summoning of a dracolich, but alas, it did not work, and left me open for attacks, and he made use of it. For he had already struck me hard, and now with but a single word he managed to subdue me and my soul left my body, for a second time.

But I had bought enough time, and my companions managed to finish what I set up for they cut down Cole where he stood. 

&nbsp;

And with that we won, a follower of his regain control of their mind, the spirit of Tess' father, and revived me and another, for I have still use in this world, and then he left the realm of the living.
