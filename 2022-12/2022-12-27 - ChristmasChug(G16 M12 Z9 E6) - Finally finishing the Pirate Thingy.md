# Quest Report
`Author: aaazzzrrr (Calindal 18, H11)`


It was a quick and bloody fight. No holds were barred, and our justice was swift.

&nbsp;

Milfindoo held her speech, beholden by an aboleth. Her vampiric court flocked her. The cowardly abberations and the craven vampires both in tow. We launched into a sprint, a combat filled with blood and thunder. My sword cut through vampire and aboleth both. I still remember how to fight them. Neither stood a chance before me. Rend flesh from bone, and mucus does not touch me. The Lunar Lady protects me. My justice is swift. My comrades rend them with spells and shot. They do not know combat with an aboleth.

&nbsp;

My comrades finish the fight as well. Milfindoo freed, as well as her court. I petition her, and my comrades, to cleanse the undead. I am refused. I will visit justice upon the haven if I see any outside of it. Blorg received his deals. The people of the haven suffer no longer. My duty has been fulfilled. Gwyneth should be pleased, though I doubt the Lunar Lady approves of my inability to cleanse the unliving. I pray she forgives me.
