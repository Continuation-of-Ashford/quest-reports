# Quest Report
`Author: aaazzzrrr (Calindal 17, H10)`


Our toil in the pirate haven bore fruit recently. Following up on recent information from Felix, whereby he realized who the secret manipulators of the island are, we sent into motion our plans for liberating it from the aboleth aberrations pulling the strings.

&nbsp;

Our people were hired and spread over the town by the mad queen Milfindoo. Some in hightown, midtown, and some in lowtown; I was among the ones in lowtown.

&nbsp;

When our work was done, we reconvened at the tavern, discussing our course of action to free Blorg and incapacitate the pirate queen's puppet masters. We decided on the following plan; ehen the queen inevitably comes down from her ivory tower to greet her citizens in midtown on the day of celebration of their survival, Jolly Day. We would sweep in and incapacitate her, as she is busy with her revelries. Her guards would be too weak to oppose us, the real battle was the aboleths.

&nbsp;

After being summoned by the pirate queen again, we managed to catch Blorg from her clutches and bring him outside through telepathy and clue him in to our plan. We received payment. Cairnas asked for much higher pay for his work digging latrines across the city and lowtown, practically indulging in endeavors fitting an architect. I'm surprised the queen let him get off the hook for that one.

&nbsp;

We reconvened at the tavern, and told the plan to Blorg to help us in executing it. We had two days to divert the population of the island from midtown on the day, and tell our allies in the guard of our plan. Me and Felix went to lowtown, keeping the people fed and supplied better so they did not need to come to midtown on the day, and told them not to do so for their safety. Felix also spoke with the guard captain to work with us in subduing the aboleths.

&nbsp;

On the day of, we came together with Blorg to compete in games and look inconspicuous. We managed to win the grand prize of a game called squishball, and brought home a trophy, gold, and a magical shield. It was a good time. I wish we had more of those simple games and joy.

&nbsp;

Our final movement came when Milfindoo held her speech and finished it with great pride. Gaulderscion moved in and gave the signal, igniting their sword in its sheath. I called for my steed to take flight at the aberrations. All of our comrades moved. Another entry is deserved to describe the consequences of the battle. May the Watcher of Souls watch over us evermore,
