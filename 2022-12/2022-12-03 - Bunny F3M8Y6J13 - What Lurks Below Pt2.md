# Quest Report
`Author: Ignore Me J17|A11|T10|WD6`


So we continued our exploration of the underground “mine” and after travelling across heavily trapped tunnels and running through the poisonous corpse of a dead Purple Worm, our team (me, myself I: Theoderik Gibbeousmoon Junior, Gwyneth the high priestess of Moonrest, Felix the most glorious cat protector, Calindal the mute paladin, Cairnas the giant dwarf and Xia the Vecna worshipper) managed to reach what was obviously a portal area at the end of the drow tunnel complex. 

&nbsp;

It was a tall circular room, around 100-120 feet high, with a full nest of Driders living at the top. Obviously one spotted us and immediately crossed the portal. The 10 remaining Driders attacked us. The fight was hard but we triumphed thanks to a well placed dawn spell, killing the drider leaders. Two of soldiers went hiding at the top of the room,, defeated, and a third managed to go through the portal. The rest of their group remained dead on the floor.

Calindal bravely crossed the portal to follow it and we felt obligated to follow him. That kind of choice tend to end badly. And it kinda did.

&nbsp;

We ended up in the presence of some Lolth servant named Hallistra Melarn, a self proclaimed *Herald*(whatever it means) with a massive size and spiderlike body, like most of Lolth’s servants in this damn place. Xia tried to communicate with her (it, them , whatever it was) but of course it turned sour. And the surprise: the power of the other gods weren’t working against her and she really wanted to see Gwyneth die. I guess that the price Gwyneth get for worshipping a drow god. Even if she says it’s an aspect of Ilmater. Well at least her god answered her call and killed the wounded (our group’s work) Hallistra with a flying staff falling down the sky through the whole ground. And after that quite violent series of fights, the place was quickly freed from drow presence.

Sadly the decaying corpse of the Herald turned to dust and it was absorbed by a weird statue in the room, announcing the future reincarnation of said Herald. We contacted the gods to know what to do and they told us to do nothing. That was worth the call, I guess. I guess we will met that crazy giant spider of a mad-half-woman later.
