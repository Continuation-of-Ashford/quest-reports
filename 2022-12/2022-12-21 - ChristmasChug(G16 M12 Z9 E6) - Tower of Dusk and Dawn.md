Watcher of Souls, guide me on this journey. My crusade for you lasts evermore.

&nbsp;

After our auspicious meeting with a spirit of the Celestials that came and spoke with Gwyneth, and our even more auspicious meeting with Faelyn, we became encouraged to continue our march north and uncover the wayshrine that we must cleanse.

&nbsp;

Before we did, however, we came upon two pillars, two towering monuments that reached into the clouds in that same valley. Cairnas, me, and Faelyn were the only ones inclined to explore them. And so it was.

&nbsp;

The first monument we came upon was white as marble, yet durable to the ages and made of limestone. Warm to the touch, evoking hope and righteousness. The past showed itself to Cairnas, who spoke Primordial, and Faelyn as well. It was a monument to a victory rarely seen against the great evil, the vile fiend of the past. The tribesmen of the Mesas spoke of such a victory, as well as the end of their servitude to the decadent Durothil. A battle fought in the valley, long ago. Faelyn looked perturbed from it. It seems at our first meeting that our instincts were correct, and she is from a time long since past.

&nbsp;

At that, I chose to scout farther across the valley to the black pillar. I took Venaan with me, my errant steed. And what we flew over on our destination, what we saw on the ground of the valley, was the reliving of that same massive battle between good and evil. Celestial energy, a presence of great power kept this vision propelling, perhaps betraying the fact that it was merely a monument from the heavens to a great victory for them. Or, the spirits were trapped in an endless memory. I know not which is true. Must commune with the Watcher of Souls to discover more.

&nbsp;

The black pillar itself; a monument to the Durothil. The evils that sundered the land so long ago. Their slaves cast their chains off and overthrew them here, winning a battle they wouldn't have won without hope. The pillar had a message in the High Elven language written on it, a proclamation that their evil was a savior. A protector. A guardian. The Lord of Lies himself would be jealous.

&nbsp;

I brought my comrades over and above the sea of moving souls, and they conducted their own research on the pillar. It was made of obsidian, and felt cold to the touch. Cairnas fashioned a tool to dig this stone, tipped with diamond from a spell, and carved out a hundred 'grams' of the material. It stopped feeling cold to the touch, yet when held and put against the rock of the pillar, it became so again. We decided we gleamed all we could of the pillars then, and chose to march forward, prospectives for the future in mind.

&nbsp;

We then arrived at a large plain of tall grass that would reach all of our length if we did not have our steeds. In the distance, we saw a dome fashioned of stone and earth, a cave most likely made by man, up a hilly climb. We marched forth, gaining speed towards it, Faelyn rushing to see it. Before we could truly begin our climb up the hill to the cave, however, our steeds were stopped. I recognized this ward as Forbiddance. Truly strange, however, was the fact it forbade Venaan, a Celestial from entering, and Cairnas' stone construcr from doing so as well. Perhaps this place was meant for mortals alone. That is where this entry shall end, for what happened next deserves its own.

&nbsp;

May the Watcher of Souls and the Lunar Lady grant me haste in my steps, and truth in my strikes.
