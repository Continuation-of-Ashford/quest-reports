# Of Scales and Skeletons
The 2 Krakenhammer ships in the Scales have spotted a group of undead attacking a ruin on one of the islands. It is unclear where the undead came from or whom is inside that ruin, but there is a chance survivors of the crashed steamship are holed up in there, so adventurers are being sent in to resque whomever's inside.
