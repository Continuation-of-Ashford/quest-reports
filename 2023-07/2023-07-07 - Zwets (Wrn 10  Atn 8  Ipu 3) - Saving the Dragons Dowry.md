# Saving the "Dragon's Dowry"
Through entirely acceptable means (and definitely not through diplomatically disastrous spying) Rangrim Ironmace has discovered the diplomats from New Lumdom didn't make it back to their home as their ship was damaged on the way back and is now beached on one of the islands near the Scales.  Because it would be a very bad look for clan Krakenhammer if something happened to the diplomats of their new ally, it is all hands on deck as multiple rescue ships are being sent out.  Because their best jungle tracker refuses to go, the dwarves are instead looking for skilled adventurers willing to brave the jungles to find and hopefully rescue these diplomats.
