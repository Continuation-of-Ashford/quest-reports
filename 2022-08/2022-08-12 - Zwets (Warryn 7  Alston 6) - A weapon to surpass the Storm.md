# A weapon to surpass the Storm
In her search for revenge on the marid, Felosial feels she is in need of a powerful weapon with which to fight the Storm Elemental. The power of fire!  The Fire Giants up atop the volcano north of Port Red Key are constantly making weapons, maybe we can trick them into giving us something big to use. Or what if we just steal some from them.  But giants are pretty strong, and a whole volcano full of them might be dangerous...  Alternatively, there is this big clockwork dragon laired in an old monastery in the Zen Coast. Just south of Fentyr. It'll be dangerous but that this is like giant walking flamethrower, we could scrap it for parts.

The Clockwork Monastery

&nbsp;

So me, Urisk, Asterios and Merrick were tasted to obtain a powerful weapon to help in the fight against the storm elemental. 

After talking it over we decided to go up the mountain to a monastery. A clockwork dragon seemed to live there, and when defeated his parts could be used to build a cannon for defence. 

&nbsp;

Travelling up the mountain was obviously not a problem for me, and thanks to that the others followed easily as well. It was a very new monastery, which was build very nicely. It was build less than hundred years ago, which was amazing to find since most of the ruins I get to are way older. It is then always great to find those old ruins in good shape (at least in good shape compared to the age) but finding such a fresh feat or architecture is amazing! 

&nbsp;

The architecture was truly great, It consisted of multiple buildings at varying heights. And each of these buildings were their own part of the cliff. This meant that in order to travel from building to the next you had to use stairs, with the cliff on 1 side and on the other side another gap with a waterfall. And some of these stairs were mined out of the mountain itself. 

I just can't do the monastery justice with words alone. The buildings had multiple levels, and it was even possible to travel from 1 building to the next higher up. Or even just to travel to a cave inside the mountain where the monastery was build around.

&nbsp;

Anyway, while we were travelling through the monastery to find the "dragon" and just checking out the buildings, we found a monk. Looked like a clockwork monk. Gave us some advice not to continue but that is about it. So yea, we continued. Soon we found ourselves in a deep battle with the clockwork dragon. Apparently the others had spotted the dragon before me and were chasing after it. I ran with but since they never actually told me what they saw it was a bit of a shock when I suddenly saw the dragon.

&nbsp;



Before I could even get close enough to the dragon to smack it Asterios knocked him off the ledge and the dragon flew away. 

While he was flying away towards a higher spot in the monastery, the coward that he is, he burned me and Asterios from the air. 

&nbsp;

Once we got rid of some of the burn marks we chased after it, up the stairs and found it lying and waiting a bit ahead. Asterios got hit hard yet again and went down. With Asterios retreating, and Urisk tending his wounds, me and Merrick stepped up to block them from getting hit by the dragon.

&nbsp;

When I finally managed to get a good hit in, I really hit him good. I managed to stop him from flying while hitting him hard, and knocking him so hard that he fell of the ledge down like 300 ft.

Took him a bit to eventually fly back up (I seriously don't understand why clockworks, whom are made of metal, thus the very earth of existence, would want to keep flying) and he just flew past us again sitting even high up in this monastery. Didn't take us long after that to beat him anymore with how hurt he had gotten.

&nbsp;

I managed to scrap him for the parts we needed after visiting that beautiful cave that I mentioned earlier and we got ready to take off.

&nbsp;

We just had a short conversation with the monk again, whom apparently is a ghost monk inside a clockwork monk, and warned us of Cole. Apparently Cole is the reason this monastery is abandoned. Cole is much more dangerous than he seems. So watch out because he doesn't only fight with his warrior centaurs, but also with sickness and disease.
