# A weapon to surpass the Storm
In her search for revenge on the marid, Felosial feels she is in need of a powerful weapon with which to fight the Storm Elemental. The power of fire!  The Fire Giants up atop the volcano north of Port Red Key are constantly making weapons, maybe we can trick them into giving us something big to use. Or what if we just steal some from them.  But giants are pretty strong, and a whole volcano full of them might be dangerous...  Alternatively, there is this big clockwork dragon laired in an old monastery in the Zen Coast. Just south of Fentyr. It'll be dangerous but that this is like giant walking flamethrower, we could scrap it for parts.
