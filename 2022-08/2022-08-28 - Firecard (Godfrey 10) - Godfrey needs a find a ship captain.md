# Quest Report
`Author: aaazzzrrr (Calindal 11, T4)`


Godfrey hired us this week on an errand mission to find him a shipmaster and captain for his merchant fleet, for his fear of piracy and need for protection and order are great. He gave us 6000 gold coins to accomplish this. Representing Moonrest, me, Cairnas and Wally, along with Book the mighty tabaxi, came to initiate a job offer between any captain we might find in Port Red Key and Godfrey. When we found a Waterdavian captain in a tavern, we made our case that it was a stable job, and offered him a good challenge, and so he accepted the offer for the sum of 3000 gold coins. We sailed back to Kasr village on board of the ship, captained by the Waterdavian by the name of "Lucky Jack." A storm caught us on the way, and we had the chance to see how Jack's crew operated expertly under duress. Not only that, the crew of the ship was very well treated and their morale was high. The captain was truly fit for the job.

Once we finished our goal, we left with the remaining payment of 3000 gold coins which we split amongst ourselves, and then went home.
