# Quest Report

*A mission report in terrible handwriting is left by Blorg*

Welp. We did it- we killed that fat bastard. My plan to put a bag of holding inside another worked like a charm. Fatty almost held onto his throne when we caused the big hole in reality- but it snapped shut, sending the jerks ass to the astral plane while his fat head stayed in his throne- nice and detached. Good thing I didnt tell the party about the 40KGP I found hidden in a chest behind his throne.....wait this is going on the mission report board isnt it....well shit
