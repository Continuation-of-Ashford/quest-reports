# Quest Report
`Author: Ignore Me J13|A9|T6`


Henry Wilabee(H.W.) got a business request. In my town. Aren’t I lucky? What’s next? A fey invasion ? A fire giants’ war declaration? 

H.W. wanted our dear friend Bill Durlow out of business “definitively”. Looks like Bill’s inability not to sell extremely powerful magic items at stupidly low price is running poor HW out of business. Too much powerful basic material on HIS market at a too low price. RUIN. CHEAP MAGIC ITEMS. How will he survive when the city finally gets its own enchanters, which should be soon enough, I wonder?

So *me,myself, I*, Junior, *Princeps of the Port of Red Key* and my comrades Fjaldar, Cairnas and Urisk went to met H.W. and see what he was offering. The answer: 20 000 gold each to get rid of a man ruining his business. My dad got less money for murdering an extremely rich dwarf magnate under a gold dragon protection. And he had to change name after that. But you have to understand, little Bill is a **threat to free market**. Because, of course, you are definitively on the verge of ruin if you are bribing people 20k gold to run your main business rival “out of town” at that price. I guess this was HW trying to be polite and just bribe me.

Bill being Bill, we only managed to get him to stop selling his extremely powerful magical material for a few months and to do so, I had to drop the name of Henry Wilabee as a reason why he should stop. Of course, it worked. And of course once again, H.W. had one of his little spy on us (the man murdered that insane tribesman chief during the Kasr/Hill barbarian tensions, using that really nice magic rapier which I will totally *not* take from his corpse if I ever have the occasion- okay I may be lying there). And that spy was watching us talk to Bill, magically or reading lips, your guess. I actually did try to convince Bill to talk under a magical tiny hut at the start of the conversation to prevent such events but the man is a real mule when he wants to be.

And despite us managing to convince Bill to stop his business, if only temporarily, HW claimed we breached an important part of our contract by using his name and refused to pay us *any money at all*. It’s not the first time, it may end up being his last time, I guess he didn’t get rich by paying his employees. It possible he wouldn’t have been able to anyway and I didn’t expect the business to go any other way. I personally suspect he isn’t that good of a businessman as he pretends to be, but some idiots may be fooled and it may cause some problems .I think he just expected us to kill Bill and the whole thing was his idea of bribing me just not to have problems with the law in *my* city. I guess he will now send his man to kill Bill. I guess I will just be a good citizen of my town and protect a city hero, murder a few of HW muscles and call it a day. I should expect some surprise. It should greatly improve Henri’s business prospect. Those trinkets we brought from Bill will surely help.
