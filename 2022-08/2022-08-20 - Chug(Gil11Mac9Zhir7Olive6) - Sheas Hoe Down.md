# Quest Report
`Author: aaazzzrrr (Fjaldar 10, T4)`


The meeting at Shea's Wake, held at the behest of Shea herself, was joined by the following persons of interest: Godfrey of Dead Man's Post, Theoderik of Port Red Key, Felix Locksley the pioneer, Rob Boss the performer of creation, and myself, Calindal of Moonrest, known as Fjaldar among my peers.

&nbsp;

Our meeting discussed the threats that face greater Ashford, the civilization that we have so far built together. The existential threats that pose grave consequences to us all are the following: near Dead Man's Post, beneath lake Ea, a colony of Illithids grows and infects the lake and the river with their tadpoles. Shea has brought a pesticide against their young which if administered to the waters, will give us more time to defeat the Illithids. Near Port Red Key, a hive of Kythons quickly become a grave threat to the city and its inhabitants, and the fire giants that live near them are the key to our success against those fiendish creatures. And as for Moonrest, it is threatened by the chaotic forces of Cuen's Chorus, a sorcerer beyond equal that brings forth the feywild onto the material. I and Gwyn must find, together, the key to defeating that ancient evil.

Perhaps this meeting will bear fruit in the future. But for now, it will be chronicled for the ages like so.
