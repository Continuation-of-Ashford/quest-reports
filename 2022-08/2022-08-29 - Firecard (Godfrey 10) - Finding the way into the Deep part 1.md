**Mind flayer magic**

&nbsp;

This is the first report of Glycon Cyfrin since he has arrived into the formerly unknown region of Ashford. 

As part of his studies into the magics of the world he found himself joining a group of adventures that were tasked with a way to withstand the psionic powers of mind flayers. 

This obviously provided a good way for me to learn more about the magic situated in this region, while also getting a feel for the land by travelling around with a few people who have walked this area before.

&nbsp;

After getting our task, the group decided to visit a fellow scholar and wizard situated south of Kasr. I heard from the group that there were some bad omens from seasons past, but we needed the information so forward we went.

&nbsp;

Once we arrived I however quickly changed my opinion. We were welcomed freely by the guards and could enter without much trouble. Once the Scholar had approached us and asked what we needed, he seemed more than willing to offer us the information we wanted and even shared with us ideas on where to find the items we needed to complete our mission and an extra book to teach us a valuable skill to hopefully avoid a fight. This is certainly a library I would love to visit again to peruse around and have more conversations with the wizard. 

&nbsp;

Anyway, we were informed of a temple in an habitat island off the coast of our current land. Once we arrived on the island we made friendly contact with the natives, managed to trade with them food that we caught on the way, in return for permission to enter the temple. Although only a few of us dared enter the temple, it was apparently fully save to enter. Here we found multiple rings that appear to withstand the mind control of the mind flayers. For the group this is of course the biggest price there is. But not for me, I found something a lot better. 

Now although I am not as knowledgeable about divine magic, I have to say that it feels good. Because when I entered that temple I learned the innate ability to FLY! Without wings, and without the need to actively cast or use my spells or disciplines I have earned the divine right to fly. I am of course still practising, where currently the landing seems to be the hardest part. But I will get it down some day. 

&nbsp;

I hope my recollection of our task to find a counter to the mind control is enough for this report. I have not yet written one before since I have only just arrived, but I heard that others do like to read about the different kinds of magics of the greater region so I hope this is acceptable. 

&nbsp;

Feel free to come up to me for a conversation, and I will be more than willing to show to you my flying prowess. Although I formerly did not care much about divine magic, I might be tempted to seek it out more.

&nbsp;

With regards, 

*Gly "The Fly" Cyfrin*
