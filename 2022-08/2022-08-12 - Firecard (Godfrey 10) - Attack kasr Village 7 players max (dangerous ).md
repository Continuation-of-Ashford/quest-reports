# Quest Report
`Author: aaazzzrrr (Fjaldar 9, T4)`


As we came to Kasr Village upon hearing the news of an approaching attack from the elementals of the sea, our party sought help from the local guard, the soldiers of Godfrey, and the clerics of Moonrest, and then in addition a machine of war spewing fire perched on the wall. As soon as we came upon the place, we began to take positions in the fortified fort built into the cliffside near the docks, whereupon we built ourselves into a fortified position in order to protect Namkuzu, one of the leaders of Kasr itself. The toughest warriors I know pledged their lives to defeat the scourge of the seas in that battle, and when it began, we were bled dry by lightning, tridents, salt and brine and all the terrible fury of the seas. We suffered many casualties, the soldiers being felled one by one, the clerics and guards losing their lives after holding the line. One of our own even fell in that battle, Cairnas the Stonesinger, though he was revived by magics I have never seen before. But despite it all, the elementals fled when their moment of triumph eclipsed and their hope of success was lost, and we survived the battle with Namkuzu alive.
