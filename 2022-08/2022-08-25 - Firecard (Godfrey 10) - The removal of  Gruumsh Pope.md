(The following text is encoded with a cypher, but a simple Comprehend Languages easily fixes that)

&nbsp;

-This is Warryn Nibler reluctantly writing you.-

-Compelled to supply you information.-

-Currently located on Toril. The Farashad Islands. Dead Man's Post.-

&nbsp;

-A local sect of religiously militant orcs has been growing in followers.-

-Primarily due to their leader called "The Prophet of Gruumsh".-

&nbsp;

-Under the guise of mural painters myself and other transported individuals: Calindal, Roland, Book, Junior, Rob and Nox infiltrated a stacked pile of rocks called a temple.-

-Junior pulled strings as a ~~bar.~~ ~~lor.~~ ~~may.~~. Actual title unclear, effectively a king in all but name. Contacts procured a powerful poison.-

-Rob Boss smuggled in a barrel of hazardous liquid.-

&nbsp;

-Book spread rumors amongst war chiefs. Relating battles fought with Illithid on Balto island coast.-

&nbsp;

-It took a couple weeks but we managed to replace the Prophets blessed drinking water with a concoction of both poisons.-

-The poison only weakened the Prophet.-

&nbsp;

-The painter, Rob is remarkably proficient at subterfuge.-

-Created a moving and flying, near perfect replica of an Illithid.-

-Fake Flying Illithid dumped the chemicals on the Prophet. Then disappeared as if teleporting.-

&nbsp;

-Calindal then convinced the orcs to place Prophet under his medical care.-

-Prophet is Feebleminded for at least a month.-

&nbsp;

-Recommend my lady replaces entire network with painter bards, I wish to be obselete.-
