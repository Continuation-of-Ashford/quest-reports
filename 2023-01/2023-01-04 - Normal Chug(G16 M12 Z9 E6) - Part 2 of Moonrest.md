### Downtimes
* aaazzzrrr (Calindal 18, H11): Calindal whistles as if nothing is wrong and deconstructs a vicious yklwa (2/3).
* Dork (Pop 16, Gwyn 14, Naki 4): Gwyn examines her pauldron over the week. It has a white handprint on it, and it looks as if someone dipped their hand in white paint. Something appears off about it, including the details of crevices left by wrinkles. In dawn the mark glows blue. It could be a magical effect, instead of something divine. It doesnâ€™t seem to be something Ilmater or Naralis would do.
