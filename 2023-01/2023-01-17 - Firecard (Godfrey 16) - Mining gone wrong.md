Apparently, several miners had been missing in Godfreys mines. Usually I would have suspected that they just were mistreated and ran away. BUT, since the posting mentioned they had vanished within the mine itself, I figured it might warrant somewhat of an investigation.

&nbsp;

Me, Silan, Christya and Glycon set off, it was an easy enough place to find and we wandered into it.. only to be assailed by wraiths. I have to say, my former abilities would likely have been just as useful in this fight, as the undead swarmed the group with little hesitation. 

&nbsp;

After the scuffle. 'someone' needed to catch their breath, and recover their faculties it seemed, and despite my misgivings we headed outside.. giving a wrathful bone dragon the opportunity to take to the skies.

&nbsp;

Sadly, some of the villagers lost their lives in the assault. The group saw to it that their undead forms did not suffer long, and then we refocused on the bone dragon.

&nbsp;

I could  feel the undead nature of the creature, and it still lingered on my fingertips.. We all assailed it with the stronger powers at our disposal, as I held it in place for the final blow. Its undead will no match for Sehanine's light. We mourn those we failed to protect. But have to remember those that survived. Thanks to our intervention. -Kadri Moonsworn.
