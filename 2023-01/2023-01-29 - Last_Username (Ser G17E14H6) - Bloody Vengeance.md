# Bloody Vengeance
Dozens of people ranging from lowly farmers to wealthy merchants have gone missing from their homes overnight. The only evidence (besides the obvious) of any wrongdoing is the demonic runes scrawled in pigs' blood in their homes. Unsigned letters written to the heads of state of each settlement have arrived. They read: Let it be known that our Lord of Battles breaks no oaths and begets no traitors. If you wish to see your people returned, you will send the sons and daughters of Old Ashford to the center of the Salt Flats to reclaim them. You have until tomorrow's eve. If you dare send anyone else, we will kill the hostages. If you attempt subterfuge, we will call the stars down upon one of your cities.
