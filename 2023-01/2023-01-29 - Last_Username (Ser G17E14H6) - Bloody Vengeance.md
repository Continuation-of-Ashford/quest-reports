# Bloody Vengeance
Dozens of people ranging from lowly farmers to wealthy merchants have gone missing from their homes overnight. The only evidence (besides the obvious) of any wrongdoing is the demonic runes scrawled in pigs' blood in their homes. Unsigned letters written to the heads of state of each settlement have arrived. They read: Let it be known that our Lord of Battles breaks no oaths and begets no traitors. If you wish to see your people returned, you will send the sons and daughters of Old Ashford to the center of the Salt Flats to reclaim them. You have until tomorrow's eve. If you dare send anyone else, we will kill the hostages. If you attempt subterfuge, we will call the stars down upon one of your cities.

So the missing people were saved. At least for now, I guess. We went to the meeting point at the tower in the middle of the slat plain. They had been kidnapped by Rakshasa working for Rak Tulkhesh. Our old friend Tony wasn’t there but his replacement Lorenzo was. He asked us to bend the knee and serve his bullshit god/master. Rake Tool Shed was there at the top of the tower, looking down on us. We killed Lorenzo first. Then we wasted our time killing his tiger shaped minions and had the hardest time fighting what was a new version of those already tough Crystal Golem. What a horrible creature: it can bounce Radiant damage back to everyone around it, it blind people in a 10 feet range, it can slow you. It’s still weak to magic weapons, fire and necrotic damage but damn if it’s not tough. 

&nbsp;

It somehow managed to thrown Gwyn into the greenish soul river at the feet of the tower and from the look of it, it hurts swimming into that river of souls.

&nbsp;

After killing the crystal golem (good work Poppy!), we all followed Bastielle into the tower. No real change there since the last visit, if you ignore THE WALLS BEING COVERED BY RAK TULKHESH MAGIC GLYPH, absorbing the tower soul energy to power what we learned was a dimensional opening to that insane god dimension.

&nbsp;

So we reached the top of the tower and the lord of evil monologue gave us a speech then opened the portal, teleporting us out of the tower range. 

I would stay away from the place if I was you. Also there is a portal to demon land in the middle of the continent now. It’s run by an insane god. Enjoy.
