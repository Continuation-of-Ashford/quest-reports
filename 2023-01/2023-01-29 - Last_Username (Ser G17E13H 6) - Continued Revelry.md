Continued Revelry. Quest Report By Selene Solace

It was another day at the Circus. It reminded me of home but this time I had new friends. The first event we participated in was we had to move a key among us but if we hit a wire then all of us would feel a little funny. The crowd laugh as I failed a few times the look on my friends faces were something to die for I was trying my best to put on a good show but it seemed that my friends were frustrated so they yelled at the orchestrator to have us fight with something but they said they were going to have us play with some doggies. But these doggies were about the size of a house and looked funny unlike any dog I have seen before with really long necks and big feet. We played with the doggies for a bit but the doggies broke sadly and stopped moving after Franz and Ozulefu broke them. It's usually my fault that toys get broken but it seems like I have got more in common with my new friends. The next game was tug of war with a weird looking cow. I tried to make the crowd on their seats with us losing in the first half and winning in the latter half but the cow got tuckered out. The Butcher lady said that there was a last challenge. I asked her what it was but it wasn't clear. Lazare said he didn't want to die and asked what we wanted on tombstones. It seems he really does value are friendship that means so much to me but at the same time aren't we here to put on a good show so I answered with a resounding “With having the crowd roaring she put on a good show that her father Rakdos would approve of putting on a good performance with shrouding of applause and blood dying in her last moments, having her last moments be of what she waited for only thing she wish would happen is that the circus would turn into a riot just like how it was told to her in stories she heard of when growing up.” We fought her more or less. She kinda stabbed me a bunch. It hurt kinda but nothing too much I got back up then tried to beat her up again but after that I don't remember much they said I died and a riot happened. I guess no matter where you are you find people who remind you of home, I was getting homesick so it's good this happened so I could enjoy this place with my friends. Shame the circus got shut down for a bit though.
