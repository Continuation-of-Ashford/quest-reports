# New london Arise (Heavy Rp)
Men in strange accents have arrived in different cities around new Ashford. Most of these people are traders and explorers. They wear weird clothes and speak in the most strange of accents. They say they're from a place called New London. A city inside a deep fog.  A letter was sent to Godfrey and inside the letter, a man called himself called Arthur Macdonald is leading a diplomatic party to the dead man's post to meet Godfrey for a meeting.  In Return Godfrey wishes to meet these new people and hopes their friendly. So he's gathering some allies in case the meeting turns bad. Meet at Godfrey's palace
