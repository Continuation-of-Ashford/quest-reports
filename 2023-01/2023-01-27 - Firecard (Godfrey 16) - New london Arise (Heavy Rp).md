Our diplomatic mission to meet the denizens of another world, "New London," was an interesting one. From the moment we brought our gifts, and spoke with their leaders, it became clear that they are inept and barbaric. Their entire culture is built upon a monstrous expansion of power, and propagation of wealth. They are godless, as they hold no communion with their one and only god for which they have no name, and their ideals begin and end with their nation. They are worse than the orcish tribes I have met in my time.

&nbsp;

Their general is not only a brute, but also an idiot and a liar, and apparently has information on all of us. He was not a fiend, or celestial, so it must mean he's either a loyal sockpuppet, or he has allies far beyond his ken. Either way, let it be known to never speak with him. Nothing productive will come out of it, and your time will be wasted. Even his name is forgettable, but I'm sure he will shout it at any given opportunity, so I wouldn't bother remembering it.

&nbsp;

In contrast, the other leaders were much more welcoming. Lady Alexis and lord MacDonald accepted our gifts and told us the nature of their conflicts. For a time, the leaders of the three cities and the leaders of New London mingled in the court of Godfrey, and all was well.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, however, and unseen by anyone else... an assassin was promptly found and shot by the former general we met. Their leg was cut off from the force of the shot that rang out. Blood splattered across the attendants. Apparently, the heir of their kingdom was almost assassinated. Very suspicious situation, especially considering none of us took notice. Perhaps a ploy by the general to garner political favor, but its obvious he doesn't have the mental faculties for it. Keep your eyes open around the people of New London, my fellows.

&nbsp;

In any case, the assassin was healed and prevented from being executed on the spot. We argued that Godfrey should have the say on their fate, and that we could find out more if they were alive. Out came Godfrey's... "fey torturer." It extracted information from the assassin through wicked magic.

&nbsp;

After a fruitless conversation with the general, the admiral of the navy came to speak with us about the nature of their predicament, and that if their rebellious subjects were successful, that Ashford would be the target of an invasion. A veiled threat, but a sensible goal. Ultimately, we required more information, but I was sure that if it helped avoid bloodshed, it was worth seeking. And that concluded our diplomatic affairs.

&nbsp;

In summary, don't meddle with New London unless you have to. The Lunar Lady willing, lives can be saved, but they would most likely exploit you before assisting you.
