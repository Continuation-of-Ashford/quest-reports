So all the biggest most powerful players on the New Ashford political scene suddenly “felt” the need to go visit the weird crystal island north of the continent at the same time. Is it political instinct? Is it the usual greed? Is it something else? I really don’t know and I don’t really care, I just had to be there. Fear of missing out, I guess.

&nbsp;

The fact is Calindal, Gilbert, Poppy, Xia, Felix and me, myself, I, Junior all went on a boat trip to that weird looking crystal islands place, which we decided to name really originally Crystal Cove. Applause please!

&nbsp;

It’s a bullshit place and we received some serious beating by one of the six (now five) super weird Far-Realm-originating crystal invaders/leaders. Far Realm is like really bad news, Far Realm on this plane is even worse. It’s like “Mind Flayers on performance drugs” bad. Illithids allegedly came running really scared from a horribly chaotic place (the Far Realm according to some), Far Realm creatures are pure Chaos themselves after Chaos decided “nah I am going to have an actual really fucked up internal structure and it will fuck with your mind on sight”. Like they can do a lot of damage around them, they have that large spread cone-of-cold like crystal cone of death which can mess with your brain, their physical attacks can leave you confused and they do psychic damage all over the place (note to self: bring at least a few potion of psychic resistance next time). Oh and they can summon other far-realm creatures, because why not. It’s mostly Aberrations. Star-spawn creatures, whatever it means. Go ask Gilly about them, his scared face when he talks about them is worth it. I think those creatures are pretty bullshit. My dad once told me about his trip in the far realm and it sounded stupidly horrible. Like Gibbering Mouthers actually being extremely pretty creatures from there when they stay on their native side. No air. Swimming through space. Your mind controls what you can do and not do in that place? You go slowly but surely mad when you stay too long there? Hard pass.

&nbsp;

Oh and there is a female-looking self-proclaimed immortal who also claim she is keeping them at bay and kinda want us to kill all the remaining big 5 to save and “protect the rest of the continent from their toxic presence”. She is hard to miss, don’t worry about not meeting her and stay polite when you do. She is telling the truth, as far as I can tell, but I have been had too many times and not by gods, so I half expect a surprise “ahah those horrible monsters where actually keeping her prisoner here!” reveal when the job is done. Well at least best outcome is she will fuck off when the crystals are gone and/or we will make sure it happens and we will end up having a good place to settle in the north part of the continent. As a plan, it doesn’t seem easy because the one big creature we killed and who nearly killed 3 out 6 of us was the one she spent her time weakening. And it didn’t have many of their out of this world minions around it, unlike the others. 

&nbsp;

I could spend some time telling you about our small trip around the island and the weird memory storage thingies and all the memory stealing happening with it but it’s really not that interesting or , honestly, worth remembering. Go bother Gilly if you are that interested by extra dimensional creatures eating memories. 

&nbsp;

Well one down, five to go, I guess.

Also remember to bring “mind” protection with you, I guess.
