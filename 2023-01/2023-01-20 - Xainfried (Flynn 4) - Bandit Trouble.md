I once again found myself in odd company.. Harold, Larold? A wildling warrior, a winged tiefling, the odd automaton whom, I've seen in my previous excursions. Janus, an elven swordsman, and Booker. A human archer.

&nbsp;

The mission was simple, on the surface at least. Find some bandits who had been terrorizing the caravans around Port Red Key. I don't much care for the city itself, but the people need to be able to travel the roads safely.. Which was what I thought we were doing, then we were attacked.. by a band of Owlbears, of all things. The creatures were immediately hostile, and one had two heads... so we killed them. It seemed the appropriate thing to do. Probably the result of a drunken wizard.. I just hope they ate the magician before they attacked us.

&nbsp;

We did happen upon the camp in the evening. Staging a nighttime attack seemed prudent as most of the bandits were reported to be humans. Their poor eye-sight likely enabled us to get close without them spotting us too early, so we swarmed the camp, and with a combination of magic and the fear of the gods put into the hearts of the weak men, we won the day without much issue or injury.

&nbsp;

The odd thing to me seemed to be that they were lead by two aaracokra. Winged birdmen, larger than they normally grow. Two of them seemed to be the leaders of the  bandits, and in hindsight it might have been better to catch one of them alive. I might need to seek the help of a cleric to find out more from them.. Well, that shall be an option if I cannot find out what I need to know from the bandit that we did take alive.

&nbsp;

A final piece of note, was that we found a map.. showing an archipelago north-east of the mainland. I don't know if this might be where the aaracokra came from, or if it was somewhere they planned to go with the funds accrued from their raids. Again, further interrogation of our prisoner might be warranted, but that can wait. The immediate threat is over and we can now work to further prevent it in the long run.
