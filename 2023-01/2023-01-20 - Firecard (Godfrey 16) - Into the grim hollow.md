# Quest Report
`Author: aaazzzrrr (Calindal 19, H12, L4)`


Our journey into the dark portal on the isle of Balto yielded very interesting results. We were invited there by a certain count, and escorted to the seat of their nation, a city I have already forgotten the name of. The people there live miserably and magic seems to be chaotic and untrustworthy; the Weave is most likely what's unruly there, since their crystal sphere peculiarly lacks gods to regulate it. Interesting, exciting, but also troubling.

&nbsp;

Marching through to the city and ultimately the palace, Glycon encountered prejudice by the guards of the gate, and the priesthood accosted us at the marketplace. Our foreign presence was too obvious. They wanted us stripped of our weapons and magic, and wished for us to meet the emperor and be as courteous as we could. Such was the Ecclessiarchy. But as they say, in Waterdeep, do as the Waterdavians do, and I tried my earnest at courtly affairs.

&nbsp;

A series of demonstrations of magic and power later, we spoke with their ruler and came to a conclusion of where to proceed in the real mission; defeating a cult that has spread from their world to ours, an apocalyptic one that seems to use magical afflictions and the harmful chaos of the Weave to sow their corruption. We were told of how they were thwarted in earlier times, shown their vile doings, Trevor produced a mirror that showed the past and helped us in our endeavor, told of when to return and finally sent on our merry way. All in all, a successful meeting.
