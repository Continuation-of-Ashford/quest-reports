Blessed be the Lunar Lady, for the lands of Quethyr have been pacified for the time being.

&nbsp;

This great undertaking was assisted by Felix Locksley, Cairnas Cephas, Theoderik Gibbousmoon, and Poppy Lowe-Tine. My mission to Quethyr came with a solemn vow that it would be barred and gated, and its evils contained. No evil would enter to seek the weapons of the past. In a dream, I received a portent, a premonition, and assistance. Quethyr had a control mechanism for the automata that walked its soil. Constructs powered by necromancy. I would seek that control from the automata, for they were loyal soldiers and useful tools against the darkness. But when this crusade of mine is over, and when no snake will tread the grasses of Ashford, there will be no constructs left on Quethyr. So I swear.

&nbsp;

When we began marching, assistance came to us in the form of a legionnaire from beyond the plane. A human, with no evil or good in their heart. A strong soldier. They would assist, and leave at the triumph.

&nbsp;

We came to the control tower shown in my dreams, and fought through floor after floor of automata from a bygone age. Their power was formidable, and their strength was great. Useful soldiers, no doubt. Terrifying weapons in the hands of the wicked. That is why this mission should have been accomplished.

&nbsp;

Fighting to the top, we met upon rooms upon rooms of the Durothil. Stale air, a millenia of silence reigned over them. We scoured it after our victory.

&nbsp;

When we reached the top of the tower, we met upon a juggernaut, a machine far greater than any we encountered so far. Surely meant to prevent control from being taken. What followed was a gruesome battle, that ended with my sword plunged through the chassis, the light emblazoning it in glory. Quethyr was the prize at last. I had to hold the gates barred. I had to bring light to this land, from here on out. Seldarine grant me strength.
