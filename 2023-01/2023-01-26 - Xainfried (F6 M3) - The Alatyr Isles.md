# The Alatyr Isles
Adventurers recently found a map marking an archipelago that has not been seen on any map before. The Adventurers guild has taken an interest, and wish to see if there's any validity to this archipelago actually existing. Due to the unknown nature of the islands, the guild wishes to send seasoned adventurers on this exploration mission
